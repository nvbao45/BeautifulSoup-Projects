Prototype,3. Early Revenue","We invest in the following sectors and stages. 

SECTORS

We are geography agnostic with a bias toward UK/Europe/US, and our sector choice is fluid in order to respond to market changes. Areas of interest include: Frontier Deep-tech, where one of the core challenges is technical and often the market is early or nascent; e.g. AI and Deep Learning Quantum Computing Computer Vision, AR and VR Blockchain and Crypto Drones, Robotics Space-Tech Transformative Known technical solutions (SaaS platforms, marketplaces, mobile apps etc) applied to laggard markets; e.g. Fintech and next generation Business and Consumer apps/services Manufacturing, Logistics and the 4th Industrial Revolution Technology Platforms Health-tech and Death-tech The above lists are not exhaustive. 

STAGE 

We love investing super early, our sweet spot is first or second money-in. Unlike some other investors we don’t just say we invest early stage we actually do it – check our portfolio. Early stage is a broad label; specifically for us it includes: Conceptual – Seed/Pre-Seed rounds (concept/lean testing phase, BETA users/customers, no revenue). Pre-Revenue – Seed/Angel rounds (early traction and growth trajectory with users, may have some revenue). Growth – Seed+/Bridge and Series A (sustained record of growth among users, revenue and markets, looking to expand/scale). 

INVESTMENT SIZE 

Between $75k USD (£50k) and $1m (£800k), depending on stage; with an average first investment of $250k (£200k). This can be on our own but is more often alongside other angel investors or early stage founder-friendly VCs we know and trust. Building a great startup is incredibly hard; we support Founders with our 7EVN advisor network but also believe having a collective of great early stage investors is to everyone’s advantage. 

WHAT WE DON’T INVEST IN

We will not invest in any business –however good it might be — which is not a billion dollar opportunity. See above for our definition of this. We also don’t invest in areas we do not understand or where we cannot add value; FMCG and retail goods would be a good example of this.",VC,"$50,000 ","$2,000,000 "
