- We invest in companies that have a proprietary or highly differentiated product with a path towards sustainable differentiation.

- We invest in companies that will have a minimum available cash runway of 12 months post-close. 
- We invest in companies that are capital efficient and can scale quickly without a lot of additional capital. We gravitate towards entrepreneurs who treat every dollar as if it’s their own and who think carefully about raising capital – both the timing and the amount – to optimize for success.
