Our investment hypothesis centers around finding the best people working on commercially sound business models. This philosophy of not just singularly optimizing on growth metrics but considering long-term viability of the business while still achieving digital category leadership within a c. 5-8 year timeframe, is what we call “True Growth”. 

Furthermore, we focus our investments on cases where it is evident that we can provide “smart money”. I.e. opportunities where the competencies of our group are strongly relevant to get the company on a true, sustained, commercial growth trajectory. We leverage key learnings from scaling our own ventures (everyone in our group is an operator!) to global importance while retaining robust unit economics in order to pick investments and support our portfolio founders.
