We are looking for companies that have their MVP/product live and are already generating some revenue from unaffiliated customers.

SaaSholic is managed by SaaS operators, not analysts from the financial market or wealthy but inexperienced individual angels. We’ve been there and we know what it takes for a SaaS business to be successful.

We typically help our portfolio startups with go-to-market, marketing strategy, creating and scaling their salesforce, choosing the right tech infrastructure, company culture, leadership principles, and Delaware/Cayman incorporation.

(We’re not referring to the Silicon Valley cliché tips everyone reads in books and articles. We’re talking about real-life things that we’ve been through or have seen working in the LatAm market peculiarities.)
