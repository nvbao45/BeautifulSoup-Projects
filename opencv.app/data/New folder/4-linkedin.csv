We donâ€™t invest in consumer start-ups, or subscription services that have elements of recurring revenue but are not primarily software products. 

SaaStr Fund invests in 4-5 awesome SaaS start-ups a year, generally in the $0.1m to $2m ARR range.  Before $10k MRR is usually a bit too early for us, and after $2m ARR or so is usually a bit late and Series A.

Pre-revenue is too early.  We can only invest if you have at least 10 Unaffiliated Customers, and ideally, $10k+ or more in MRR.

We invest in founders that are a part of the SaaStr community.  Thatâ€™s probably you if you got here :). But if youâ€™ve never heard of SaaStr, never read a SaaStr post, heard our podcast, or been to one of our events ... there are probably better sources of capital.

We are OK with startups based anywhere in the world (SaaS has flattened), but prefer folks that come to Bay Area frequently.  It does make it easier to recruit, fundraise, partner, etc.  At least in normal times.  ",VC,"$500,000 ","$4,000,000 "
