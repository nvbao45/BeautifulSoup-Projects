Prototype,3. Early Revenue","We invest in the following sectors and stages. 

SECTORS

We are geography agnostic with a bias toward UK/Europe/US, and our sector choice is fluid in order to respond to market changes. Areas of interest include: Frontier Deep-tech, where one of the core challenges is technical and often the market is early or nascent; e.g. AI and Deep Learning Quantum Computing Computer Vision, AR and VR Blockchain and Crypto Drones, Robotics Space-Tech Transformative Known technical solutions (SaaS platforms, marketplaces, mobile apps etc) applied to laggard markets; e.g. Fintech and next generation Business and Consumer apps/services Manufacturing, Logistics and the 4th Industrial Revolution Technology Platforms Health-tech and Death-tech The above lists are not exhaustive. 

STAGE 

We love investing super early, our sweet spot is first or second money-in. Unlike some other investors we donâ€™t just say we invest early stage we actually do it â€“ check our portfolio. Early stage is a broad label; specifically for us it includes: Conceptual â€“ Seed/Pre-Seed rounds (concept/lean testing phase, BETA users/customers, no revenue). Pre-Revenue â€“ Seed/Angel rounds (early traction and growth trajectory with users, may have some revenue). Growth â€“ Seed+/Bridge and Series A (sustained record of growth among users, revenue and markets, looking to expand/scale). 

INVESTMENT SIZE 

Between $75k USD (Â£50k) and $1m (Â£800k), depending on stage; with an average first investment of $250k (Â£200k). This can be on our own but is more often alongside other angel investors or early stage founder-friendly VCs we know and trust. Building a great startup is incredibly hard; we support Founders with our 7EVN advisor network but also believe having a collective of great early stage investors is to everyoneâ€™s advantage. 

WHAT WE DONâ€™T INVEST IN

We will not invest in any business â€“however good it might be â€” which is not a billion dollar opportunity. See above for our definition of this. We also donâ€™t invest in areas we do not understand or where we cannot add value; FMCG and retail goods would be a good example of this.",VC,"$50,000 ",

We donâ€™t invest in consumer start-ups, or subscription services that have elements of recurring revenue but are not primarily software products. 

SaaStr Fund invests in 4-5 awesome SaaS start-ups a year, generally in the $0.1m to $2m ARR range.  Before $10k MRR is usually a bit too early for us, and after $2m ARR or so is usually a bit late and Series A.

Pre-revenue is too early.  We can only invest if you have at least 10 Unaffiliated Customers, and ideally, $10k+ or more in MRR.

We invest in founders that are a part of the SaaStr community.  Thatâ€™s probably you if you got here :). But if youâ€™ve never heard of SaaStr, never read a SaaStr post, heard our podcast, or been to one of our events ... there are probably better sources of capital.

We are OK with startups based anywhere in the world (SaaS has flattened), but prefer folks that come to Bay Area frequently.  It does make it easier to recruit, fundraise, partner, etc.  At least in normal times.  ",VC,"$500,000 ",

As a result, we aspire to be as responsive, transparent, and easy to work with as we can be. Friendly.

Making an investment is about capitalizing on a business opportunity as well as forming a partnership.
