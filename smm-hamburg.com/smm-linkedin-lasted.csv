54696,Abeking & Rasmussen Schiffs- und Yachtwerft SE,corporation,"A shipyard with many faces

Abeking & Rasmussen has stood for shipbuilding at the highest level for more than 110 years and over 6500 sailing and motor yachts, naval and special ships built. The shipyard, which carries out development, design and construction in-house in Lemwerder on the Weser, delivers to demanding customers all over the world.
Since 2015, yachts and ships up to a length of 125m can be built. The shipyard has already impressively demonstrated this with the largest yacht in the shipyard's history to date - the almost 100m yacht AVIVA. However, this internal shipyard record will not last long. At present, the ""big sister"" is being built in the shipbuilding shed on the Weser. But even this 118m long yacht will not be the largest ship of Abeking & Rasmussen in the foreseeable future. One can already find the next yacht with more than 120m in the order books.
These are well filled. In addition to numerous refit orders, the next generation of minehunting vessels made of high-strength and non-magnetic steel processed using an innovative 3D laser welding procedure is currently being built in Lemwerder. The Indonesian Navy has placed an order with Abeking & Rasmussen for two of these 62m naval vessels. The shipyard can also draw on a long tradition and extensive experience with these naval vessels.  Thus, in the A&R history, more than 360 units have been developed, designed and built for navies from all parts of the world. 
Furthermore, A&R is building three multi-purpose vessels over 90m in length for the Waterways and Shipping Administration of the Federal Republic of Germany. These special purpose vessels will be the world's first vessels powered exclusively by LNG for use in hazardous atmospheres.  
Learn more about the extensive orders and special features of Abeking & Rasmussen. We are looking forward to welcoming you again finally for personal talks at our booth.

54710,Alfa Laval Mid Europe GmbH,corporation,"Together for sustainable shipping:
For more than 100 years, Alfa Laval has worked with marine customers to meet their challenges. Now, as the marine industry pursues a sustainable future, Alfa Laval is delivering the solutions to bring it about. SMM 2022 offers an up-close look at the innovations shaping tomorrow – and the chance to discuss with the Alfa Laval experts behind them.

Explore the solutions that set a sustainable course:
Decarbonization will be in sharp focus at SMM. Through innovation, digitalization and thought leadership, Alfa Laval is driving progress towards this and other sustainability goals. Independently and with partners across the industry, Alfa Laval is making sustainable shipping a reality on individual vessels and across the marine industry. 

Working throughout the vessel:
Alfa Laval’s solutions and knowledge extend from bow to stern, encompassing most key applications on board. That breadth creates a unique platform for addressing sustainability challenges. 

The portfolio includes proven compliance solutions for today’s environmental regulations, such as Alfa Laval PureBallast 3 and Alfa Laval PureSOx. Likewise, it contains new solutions for meeting EEDI/EEXI and CII requirements, such as the Alfa Laval E-PowerPack and the Alfa Laval Aalborg Micro economizer. As the industry looks to low-carbon and eventually zero-carbon fuels, Alfa Laval is enabling their use by combining expertise in fuel handling, combustion, waste heat recovery and more.

Throughout the vessel, Alfa Laval provides ways to make operations more reliable and efficient – saving fuel, energy and money as well. The solutions include a growing range of digital services, from remote support to online monitoring. StormGeo, a part of Alfa Laval, has a digital offering that extends from weather intelligence and route optimization to simulating a vessel’s CII and its commercial impact.

Partnering across the marine industry:
Naturally, no supplier can solve the challenges of the future alone. Doing so requires cooperation with others across the industry. As a member of key organizations, such as the Methanol Institute and the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, Alfa Laval is contributing knowledge and supporting change.

In addition, Alfa Laval is putting technology and resources into diverse collaborations. Many of them, such as research projects with methanol and development projects with fuel cells, make use of the unique 2500 m2 testing space at the Alfa Laval Test & Training Centre. Other initiatives include Oceanbird, a joint venture between Alfa Laval and Wallenius to create modern wind-assisted and wind propulsion.

An almost revolutionary approach for on board helicopter refuelling systems show the new HRS modules PFM (Pump Filter Module) and RM (Refuelling Module) of Alfons Haar, a renowned supplier of such systems. 

Out of 3 classes which represent  100 – 680 L/min COTS (Commercial Of The Shelf) modules are available with unprecedented short delivery times. 

Standards such as CAP 437/PYC, ATEX/IECEX, CE but also military standards are met. Approvals by GL and LR are available.  

The new series of modules comes with an extreme compact design, perfect accessibility. Even the control cabinet is completely incorporated which reduces the space requirement further. For comfortable integration 3D stepfiles are available at any time. 

Wiring between modules and tanks is drastically reduced and simplified by using the famous intrinsic safe PreciCONTROL field bus, a unique development of Alfons Haar. The communication with the on board IMCS (Integrated Monitor and Control System) is provided by MODBUS RS422/485 or hardwired signal contacts.

In addition, Alfons Haar provides approved HIFR equipment (helicopter in-flight refuelling) and BRS dispensers (boat refuelling system) for dinghy (with diesel engine) and, with increasing importance, for water toy, etc., e.g. with gasoline outboards and jet-skis.

54726,Applied Integration,corporation,"Founded in Stokesley, North Yorkshire in 2005, Applied Integration (AI) design marine class panels, including generator control panels, distribution switchboards & switchgears, shore to ship power panels, programmable logic controllers (PLC) & remote I/O panels.
Specialising in electrical design of critical power applications in both infrastructure and marine industries, complete with both new and refit work.
For many years, Applied Integration has been providing UK Marine, Renewable Sectors and Offshore Energy with automation integration, power and installation and aftersales services.
Designing ships and offshore equipment to safe and environmental regulations whilst being high performing and cost effective are just some of the challenges faced today.
Ports are continuously adopting new innovative technologies to meet the demands of an increase in vessels. One example of this is Rajant Kinetic Mesh® technology which provides an adaptable, scalable and readily deployable mobile network that can easily evolve with your connectivity demands. The Kinetic Mesh technology has military-grade security and there are no restrictions on distance as long as there are a number of devices (know as BreadCrumb®) across the area this means your port stays connected.
AI can assist vessel owners and operators to comply with legislation and reduce emissions and noise when at port by upgrading your power supply to accept shore power and turn off on-board diesel generators.
For Vessels with multiple generators and shore supply power inlets, determining which power source is allowed access to the main bus is critical.
Our switchgear division has created the most scalable fully automated switchgear system for the marine market.
We have the capacity to produce robust panels including fully welded, aluminium for weight saving and shock testing for the most extreme cases.
Experience in the Automation sector with the wealth of programming expertise to hand, our Switchboards and Panels can be “intelligent” with voltage sensors and circuit telemetry being constantly monitored by a PLC.
We can also monitor thermal readings from Busbars and connections to truly make your Switchboard Smart!
AI can supply heavy lifters which have a load capacity ranging from 1 to 600 tons. These heavy lifters have the ability to work either independently or can be synchronized with other smart movers to up the payload. The AMRs communicate to plan the desired route effectively, selecting the optimal path.
These transporters are designed and manufactured according to our clients requirements and are perfect for the use in shipyards, windmill and off shore plants, steelmills and warehouses.
Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMRs/AGVs) solutions offer a far more efficient transparent operation. AMRs/AGVs play a major role in innovating supply chains by optimising the traceability, speed, and accuracy of routine transport operations.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

Quality, however, has always been the cornerstone of the company; ever since its foundation in 1889 by Carl Berkenhoff, the company has been characterized by constant innovation and excellent quality. In times of global production and supply chains as well as rapid technological change, bda connectivity is well positioned with its subsidiary in Singapore and faces the challenges of the current and future markets.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__15058__240x240px/SM22_2022_229835_3520692_av.png

The state of the mooring bollards is often unknown. The bollards are expected to withstand larger forces, but the construction and the anchoring are often worn out and no longer has the capacity to meet with increased forces. A conservative estimate is that eighty percent of all bollards are over 60 years of age. 

The smartest bollard test
BollardScan delivers a highly reliable, scientifically underpinned way of testing marine bollards in a non-destructive way. The BollardScanTM is a unique method to establish the reliability of the bollard and its foundation. And whether it still meets the design requirements of the structure. The methodology is based on the transmission of vibration and sound through the structure allowing us to pinpoint any errors.

With 155 employees, Bücker + Essing is an internationally active specialist for engine overhaul, industrial and plant services. Since 1963, we have been creating economical and sustainable solutions for shipping and port logistics with the overhaul of gas and diesel engines - at our plant as well as at our customers' sites or on board. The strong competence we have developed in mechanical processing and manufacturing is now also in demand for the overhaul and repair of components such as crankshafts, bearings and cylinder heads, as well as for the maintenance of compressors, pumps and gearboxes.
Engine and large component repair for the marine industry 
By professionally overhauling engines or repairing them in the event of damage, refurbishing components and optimising materials, we ensure that seagoing and inland waterway vessels are quickly back on course. Thanks to our new CNC machining centre, which was installed in autumn 2021, we are able to machine large engines, pumps, compressors and components for marine applications even faster, more efficiently and more precisely. If old, damaged components can no longer be refurbished or are no longer available on the market, we find pragmatic revamp solutions and reconstruct components according to samples, drawings or 3D scans. Through surface treatment, we not only protect components from wear and corrosion, but we also achieve improved running properties. 
Individual fleet maintenance concepts for port logistics
We support our customers in port logistics with customised maintenance contracts for fleet repairs of engines in load handling equipment, crane systems and vehicle technology. To ensure that the engines continue to perform safely and durably, we subject them to a professional overhaul at our factory at fixed maintenance intervals. We contribute our technical know-how and advise our customers on modifications and upgrades in the course of the overhaul. Our forward-looking spare parts management and efficient logistics to the site of operation ensure a smooth project flow.  
Repairs on site and on board
Bücker + Essing specialises in carrying out mechanical repairs to engines and components anywhere in the world and on board. Especially in the case of larger engines and components that are difficult to access, it is often more economical and time-saving to send specialist personnel to the site than to dismantle the engine and send it on its way. Our specialists and their mobile repair equipment are particularly in demand when things get technically demanding, for example in the case of cavitation damage to the crankcase or mobile cylinder liner fitting repairs.

64354,Bundesanstalt für Wasserbau,corporation,"Climate change, increasing ship sizes, large-scale modernisation and extension projects: waterways engineering in Germany faces huge challenges. The BAW is very well positioned to provide expert advice and support to the BMDV and the WSV, including in entirely new fields, such as the acceleration of investments, digitalisation or the environmentally sound design of waterways. Our core competencies are closely intertwined. In addition to consulting and assessment, we also engage in research and development, standardisation and knowledge transfer.

The BAW provides all-round advice on the technical conception and design of special purpose ships. It is responsible for the operational management of special ship construction, from the initial idea through to planning, award procedures, construction and handover to the client. Modern and environmentally-friendly drive technologies play a special role in the planning. Technology must be evaluated for its suitability in each specific case and to ensure that it meets utilisation profiles as well as environmental and climate protection goals.

As a departmental research institute, the BAW attaches just as much importance to forward-looking research as it does to current issues. We investigate the impact of climate change, support the development of low-emission ship propulsion systems or develop nature-oriented bank protection measures that help our clients make good decisions on infrastructure, the environment and mobility. Our work generates future-proof solutions that prepare the waterway and shipping transport system in the best possible way for the changing requirements.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

Since our establishment in 1973, we have built a reputation for providing outstanding client service, quality equipment, and innovative design and engineering solutions.
 
With prime locations on the St. Lawrence Seaway and Coastal BC, Canal offers a full suite of engineering services to support a vessel's entire lifecycle from conception to life extension. We provide design, build, installation, maintenance, and repair services to merchant marine, naval, and Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) fleets. We specialize in power and propulsion design, bridge and communications systems, and bespoke engineered electrical solutions.
 
Canal has cultivated long-standing partnerships within the marine industry through demonstrated expertise and ingenuity. We are proud to work alongside Seaspan on projects supporting the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) to renew Canada's non-combat fleet. Early in this partnership, we provided testing and trial procedures, electrical engineering, and commissioning services to support the Offshore Oceanographic Fisheries Vessels (OFSV).  
 
As we grew our relationship with Seaspan Vancouver Shipyards (VSY), a subsidiary of Seaspan, Canal became the Single System Integrator for the electrical design of the Canadian Coast Guard's Offshore Oceanographic Science Vessel (OOSV). We worked closely with the shipyard and prime contractors to provide electrical engineering and system integration services during the project's ""functional"" and ""production"" design phases. 
 
With considerable growth of its engineering team, Canal  is now supporting the build phases of the Joint Supply Vessel (JSV) and OOSV, as well as providing concept design services for CCG’s new multi-purpose vessels (MPV). We are also proud to be delivering the detailed electrical and controls design for Canada’s next Polar Icebreaker.
 
Our growth has allowed us to take on many other challenging projects, such as providingGulf Island Shipyards LLC with detailed engineering services for the construction of Oregon State University's Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV), delivering a fleet of HYBRIDe propulsion systems to Great Lakes Towing, as well as conceiving, designing, and delivering an electrification retrofit on PortsToronto's Marilyn Bell I, resulting in Canada's first zero-emission ferry powered solely by lithium-ion batteries, and North America’s first Automatic Shore Charging System.
 
Always striving to evolve and innovate within the marine engineering industry, Canal continues to develop customized solutions to help transition vessels from traditional energy consumption to low or zero-emission options. Winning an opportunity to provide a ZEROe power & propulsion system for a new ferry in Skagit County, Washington State, we will  provide design support to Glosten by leveraging lessons learned from the Marilyn Bell","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

54818,Climeon,corporation,"Designed for the maritime industry, the Climeon HeatPower Marine system increases the energy-efficiency of vessels via onboard waste heat recovery. Using principles of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), HeatPower Marine modules deliver carbon-free electricity directly to the ship’s grid. Our innovative ORC technology ensures optimal efficiency from low-temperature heat sources (e.g. jacket cooling water) and facilitates a space-saving, compact design. 
Climeon HeatPower Marine modules extract low-temperature heat from the jacket cooling water or HT cooling circuit of the main engine and use seawater as the cold source, simplifying the integration process and reducing operating costs. The organic working media circulating in the closed loop system within each product is non-toxic, non-flammable and has a low environmental impact with a global warming potential (GWP) lower than 1 and a near zero-ozone depletion potential (ODP). The solution can be deployed in both new build and retrofit installations and is applicable for all fuel types.
Climeon is proud to partner with shipowners such as Virgin Voyages, Viking Line, Havila Voyages and Maersk, all using HeatPower to increase energy efficiency onboard and advance their green shipping initiatives. Converting waste heat into clean electricity, our proprietary marine technology reduces fuel consumption, increases energy-efficiency and reduces both sulfur and CO2 emissions to make sustainable shipping a reality.

DEKC assists with modifications and mobilizations, and provides project-specific engineering. Our specialists in naval architecture, structural design, mechanical engineering and detail engineering are able to help with every idea or challenge.

With our structured and integrated design method, we are able to implement new ideas in an efficient and creative way. Our team of highly trained designers and specialists are constantly focused on new developments and innovations that push the boundaries of what our designs can do. All our services can be offered separately or as a single comprehensive design package. We use an integrated design approach to all our design and engineering projects, in which we bring together all different specialties involved in the work. This approach is structured in phases to build-in multiple client feedback loops and to keep control of the project scope. 

NAVAL ARCHITECTURE
We can bring the design to the point that it is ready for class approval. This includes the preparation of all plans and arrangements, calculating and compiling the necessary stability documentation, and determining speed, power, and seakeeping in our virtual towing tank. Having all these capabilities in-house maintains our integrated design philosophy and allows us to respond quickly to changing requirements. 

STRUCTURAL DESIGN
We offer services from the first set-up of the main cross-section to complete construction plans based on a full-3D engineering model, according to whichever classification society that is desired. In-depth analysis of critical areas using FEM can also be performed. Besides this, smart design of the structure can be of utmost importance in reducing building costs and maximizing deadweight. Therefore, we involve both the operator and the builder in this process whenever possible.

SYSTEM DESIGN
We include the design and layout of the on-board systems of a vessel at a early stage. This ensures no compromises need to be made to the overall design in a later stage. Work is done using 3D Cadmatic software; from basic routing for space reservation and early MTO to detailed production information. This way engineering and models from different packages, can be combined in to one model and customers can review during the engineering project by means of the eBrowser, giving full insight in every step.

DETAIL ENGINEERING
Our detail engineering department covers the complete range of marine engineering from
construction workshop drawings, production fairing, shell plate development, pipe isometrics and outfitting drawings to tailor-made production information. Our experienced staff works with the newest 3D software and forms the vital step between the design phase and the production of a vessel.

57555,Deutsches Maritimes Zentrum e.V. (DMZ),corporation,"Our aim: Strengthening the maritime sector
The German Maritime Centre was founded in 2017. We are an independent institution based in Hamburg. Our members are the German federal government as the main funder, five German states and the major maritime associations. 
Our work covers entire value chains in the fields of shipbuilding and marine technology, shipping, and ports and maritime logistics.
The challenges of co-creating and implementing research, development and innovation (RD&I) are at the core of our work. 
Our four action priorities 

Competitiveness – the same rules for everyone
We analyse regulatory and regulatory policy conditions, productivity factors and cost structures in an international context, develop proposals for the standardisation and simplification of bureaucratic requirements, and support the further development of national, European and international standards, norms and regulations - for example, with studies on import VAT, on financing instruments for the maritime sector, or on water legislation. 

Sustainability and climate change – responsibility for the environment
We consider both ecology and economy. Sustainable solutions to rapidly reduce emissions from maritime transport are needed to meet the demands of the market and comply with environmental regulations. For this purpose, innovative ideas for propulsion technology and energy sources are required. We commission studies on, among other things, the bunkering of ships with alternative fuels in German seaports; on technical regulations for hydrogen-powered inland vessels; and on the role of the maritime sector in establishing a hydrogen economy.

Technological change – into the future with high tech 
We support the German federal government in the development of new funding programmes and guidelines and with regard to European research, development and innovation projects or programmes. We analyse research and development activities, keep track of trends, and initiate projects and studies on key technologies. To this end, we have, for example, developed the Maritime Funding Compass Europe and commissioned an analysis of autonomous maritime systems and studies on energy carriers of the future.

Demography and attracting young talent - investing in fine minds
We want to support and connect stakeholders at different levels to promote the visibility of the maritime sector as a diverse, future-oriented employer. The aim is to attract talented young people and skilled career changers. For this reason, we have launched projects including a survey on securing young talent, a study on the potential of social media for the maritime industry, the Maritime Research Forum for networking science and industry and the “Outstanding academic maritime teaching” competition.

54873,DVZ-SERVICES GmbH,corporation,"For over 40 years, ""DVZ"" is a synonym for custom-made, sustainable and holistic solutions for wastewater treatment in the maritime sector. More than 10,000 of our systems ""MADE IN GERMANY"" are in reliable service on board a wide variety of ships, thus making their contribution to preserving the ecological balance of the seas and oceans.

Innovative technologies such as the highly efficient bioreactor DVZ-JZR (Jet-Zone-Reactor) and the unique membrane units of the DVZ-BMSU (Biomass Separation Unit) raise our systems to a new level for wastewater treatment on board.
The result: Clear water without solid residues! And all this with an extremely small footprint, maximum efficiency and without the addition of further chemicals or accelerators.

A high standard of the materials used and the possibility of cleaning membrane modules (even during system operation) to up to 100% of their filter performance create a sewage treatment system with an exceptionally long service life (>20 years) without having to change membranes or essential system components.

The membrane units of the DVZ-BMSU are located outside the system tank so that it does not have to be opened for maintenance and cleaning. Contact with the waste water is avoided.

Our high standards of quality, operational safety and ease of maintenance make our biological ship sewage treatment systems DVZ-JZR ""BIOMASTER""® the perfect solution for super and mega yachts, navy and special ships, ferries and ro-ro vessels as well as offshore platforms.

Our DVZ-JZR ""BIOMASTER""® systems are recommended for both new build and refit applications. Due to their modular design and the possibility to place process stages separately from each other, they find their place even in the most confined spaces.
The oil water separators DVZ-FSU ""OILCHIEF""® have been regarded for decades as a reliable and low-maintenance system for the treatment of bilge water.

Of course, also manufactured with the high quality standards of our company, we offer with the DVZ-FSU ""OILCHIEF""® a reliable bilge water separator, which can be extended by GPS trackers and other options.

In addition to waste water treatment plants and oil water separators, we also offer fat traps (DVZ-FT), automatic pre-filters (DVZ-AF), buffer and collection tanks (DVZ-SCT), lifting units (DVZ-LQ), pumping stations (DVZ-SDU) and all peripheral equipment for our systems.

54876,"Ecochlor, Inc.",corporation,"Ecochlor was founded in 2001 to provide simple, reliable, cost-effective and easy-to-use ballast water management systems (BWMSs) that can stand up to the most stringent regulations in the world.

Our BWMSs are “engineered for reliability” all the way down to the component level and are simple to operate with very few major components to maintain. This ensures maximum uptime, minimizing equipment failure and extends the life of the BWMS. Thus, reducing OPEX costs and offering ‘peace of mind’ to the ship’s crew when entering any port worldwide. 

The Ecochlor systems use a chlorine dioxide (ClO2) treatment technology which is highly effective in ALL water conditions ─ its efficacy is not affected by salinity, temperature or turbidity ─ allowing for more flexibility with a ship’s trade routes. 

Our range of BWMSs put shipowners in control of the ballast water management process by allowing them to choose which mode of operation is best for their vessels. 

BWMS products:
ECOCHLOR® BWMS: This BWMS can operate anywhere in the world with no restrictions when it comes to temperature, salinity, or turbidity.

FILTERLESS EcoOne® BWMS: This BWMS can operate anywhere in marine and brackish waters (≥ 1PSU) and with no restrictions on temperature or turbidity. 

HYBRID EcoOne® BWMS: This BWMS allows shipowners to operate their BWMS either with or without a filter. This option is suited for shipowners who wish to have the flexibility of unrestricted operation globally, with the convenience of a no-filter system. 

All Ecochlor systems use a chlorine dioxide (ClO2) treatment technology which is highly effective in ALL water conditions ─ its efficacy is not affected by salinity, temperature or turbidity ─ allowing for more flexibility with a ship’s trade routes. 

ECOCHLOR SYSTEM BENEFITS:
Filterless operation available with EcoOne® and Hybrid variants
NO problematic TRO sensors 
NO electrodes 
Very low energy requirements
No secondary treatment or neutralization allows for overboard de-ballasting from topside tanks
Only minor piping modifications for installation
Treatment for flow rates up to 16,200 m3/hour
Low power costs when cold ironing
Very low CO2 footprint

Ecochlor BWMSs are very simple to operate, but we still offer many digital and print training alternatives. Also, while on board for our chemical resupply approximately 2X per year, we can provide shipboard training to any new crew members as well as a simple maintenance check on the system if time allows. 

Ecochlor service engineers are located throughout USA, Europe and Asia. We have Regional Service Managers in the United States, China, Singapore and Europe and continue to build our worldwide in-house team with Authorized Service Partners worldwide.

Ecochlor is here for the long-term to provide reliable BWMSs. Our collaborations with other maritime environmental technology providers have made Ecochlor a ‘Green Marine’ technology and service solutions company, providing more than just BWMSs.

60538,Eltorque AS,corporation,"Eltorque develops, manufactures, and markets electric actuators and control systems for the international shipbuilding and onshore industries. Eltorque is the market leader within the mid-and-high-end vessel market built in Europe. Moreover, Eltorque consistently embarks on 50-70 new projects yearly, selling an average of 10.000 precision actuators annually.

Valve-control devices were traditionally pneumatic or hydraulic. However, Eltorque saw the potential of electronic actuators to enable remote control of valves around the ship. Such a system allows an operator on the bridge to easily monitor and control the ballast water system, the fuel system, and the loading and unloading of fluid, cargoes, tank gauging, measure pressure, and flow valve throttling, ballast water cleaning systems, exhaust cleaning, A/C systems and VA systems in general.

The huge benefit and revolution to the industry is the automatic shut-off power to the electric motor when the valve has reached its designated position. A patented self-lock technology - unique to Eltorque actuators - holds the valve in the designated position without power. This is a massive power saver compared to all other actuators on the market. 

Along with the most compact actuators design in the market, featuring the most advanced self-calibrating algorithms, remote torque, speed, and temperature control, with a self-diagnostic software to monitor the ""health"" of the valve,  Eltorque actuators, and remote valve control systems can be left alone for decades without any issues. It will live silent within the operation of the vessel doing its job without any demand for attention.

Innovation is the key to success, and Eltorque places enormous efforts into developing products and solutions for the future. Our ambition is to remain the frontrunner in the market, both in technical performance and product portfolio.

The Eltorque valve control solution can replace any conventional system, and it is evident that the FUTURE IS ELECTRIC!","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

63447,Ergon SA,corporation,"Ergon SA was established in 1987, with the goal in mind being to establish a precision manufacturing site to manufacture and overhaul fuel injection equipment for the maritime industry. For over fifteen years since its founding, Ergon SA was acting as an O.E.M for Wartsila/Sulzer parts to the engine licensees. These manufacturing contracts included the production of a wide range of spare parts giving us the complete manufacturing overview regarding medium - slow speed engines. 
Since then, Ergon has evolved in a top independent fuel injection equipment manufacturer, located in the industrial suburb of Aspropyrgos in Athens, Greece. We manufacture fuel injection components suitable for two-stroke as well as four-stroke slow and medium speed diesel engines. Inner components as well as housings of fuel pumps and fuel injection valves are well within our production capabilities. 
Our organization is split in two sections, one of course being the production section and the other being the trading section. The trading section works directly with the end customer, shipping companies, providing them with complete overhauling packages for their ship’s engines. We of course are the main fuel injection equipment supplier to the trading section of our organization. 
Our company has an ISO 9001 certification. All the procedures and rules described in this ISO certificate are constantly updated with the aim being for them to never run redundant. Furthermore, in the year 2014 we got the NATO NCAGE certificate enabling us to supply diesel engine spare parts for the defense industry. We have an inhouse quality control department that performs scrutinous checks on all produced parts to make sure they are in full compliance with the engine builders specifications.

63082,eSonar Inc.,corporation,"ESonar specializes on be-spoke instrumentation for marine and ocean applications.  We are working with classification societies on vessel noise measurement research, and on carbon intensity measurement for ships.  The outcome of this work will help ship owners maintain freedom to navigate in areas that are environmentally sensitive and that may be frequented by species at risk. Our work is laying the foundation for ship owners to demonstrate that their vessels meet emerging port and port state requirements, and to take advantage of preferential port fee structures as these become more common around the world. 

Our environmental expertise extends to persistent, low-power, battery operated sensor equipment with a focus on underwater acoustic technology and the provision of custom marine product design and software services. Our marine instrumentation measures vessel thrust and key engine parameter inputs to determine carbon intensity in real time and makes this available to crew to guide decisions.  We are working with classification societies to define carbon intensity notations that will be increasingly valuable as port states require lower carbon intensity footprints. 

We design instrumented mooring systems that can measure environmental parameters using subsea buoyancy engines to vertically traverse the water column on the mooring line. This keeps the float out of the wave zone and enables communications through a pop-up antenna that breaks the surface when the buoyancy engine rises to meet the subsea float.  

We work with the fishing industry, shipboard marine industries, offshore oil and gas, aquaculture, and autonomous underwater vehicles to develop tailormade solutions that each require.

eSonar’s standard product lines comprises sonar and acoustic systems that telemeter data back to the vessel from deployed equipment. Our acoustic telemetry systems are used by fishing companies around the globe to help harvest their quota, reduce bycatch and save fuel. We are deploying our acoustic technology to help vessels track and avoid right whales and other marine species while assisting scientists and regulators as they strive to understand and protect our vulnerable marine species through monitoring of underwater radiated noise.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

In the last years FR&C has launched several luxurious lines of custom Jeweled handles, which merge art, design and exclusive materials with the most advanced technologies into unique products, with special consideration to each client’s peculiarity.
The firm has always worked at complements and accessories design and production for shipbuilding, offering a wide selection of manufacts that have followed historical evolution from big liners, to modern cruise ships. Besides, F.lli Razeto & Casareto designs and produces highly specialized articles, meant for pleasure crafting, appreciated and requested by the most important shipbuilders all over the world, as well as high end architectural hardware. The firm has now reached a leading international position and half of the production is directed to foreign markets. 
Research, optimization, quality: F.lli Razeto & Casareto’s priorities 
In October 2021, one year after its 100th years anniversary, the company has launched two innovative unprecedented projects which summarize the most advanced technologies at the service of safety into two unique lines of  products: OSSH Network  and Antimicrobial Handles.
OSSH Network: Integrated Luminous intelligent handles system for fire doors 
An integrated system of smart door handles that light up in critical conditions to provide information such as emergency indicating escape routes with the color of light. The system interacts with external systems such as FDS,ESD, SMS, SMCS or others via  communication protocols such as  Modbus. 
The electronics are placed in special junction boxes hidden in the ceiling, wired with proprietary OSSH BUS ®system that carries network signal throughout the ship and power to the handles through the lock. 
The cable free patented power and data transfer system from the frame to the door allows easy and economical installation either on new built or on retrofit projects.
The antimicrobial handles feature ESI antimicrobial system, a metal cluster complex that emits silver ions (Ag+) and other metal ions which excite a continuous antimicrobial action on the surface of the handle itself, as well as in the environment 24/7. Esi anti microbial system is perpetual and does not  need to be recharged. The effectiveness against Corona Virus has been found with laboratory tests and certified by University of Modena e Reggio Emilia. Esi is actually a diffusion treatment and is therefore permanent, thus door handles cannot be contaminated.
The company will introduce the latest releases of  these  two innovative  projects to the industry at SMM 22

Flender marine gear boxes: designed for reliability, optimized for every type of ship – We have been serving the marine industry with Flender drive technology for many decades. Close cooperation with our customers and industry ties are the basis for long successful partnerships with our customers. In addition, know-how at process, product and system level is the most important factor in the project planning phase. Together with them, we develop individual drive concepts for all possible ship types from a power class of 1 MW.

Smooth running even at full load – through high-level engineering.
Our drives are optimized for different types of ships and bring the engine power to the propeller without unnecessary losses. Highest efficiencies and optimal power-to-weight ratios, minimal vibration and noise are well-known characteristics of our products and our first-class engineering. Our gearbox range covers many solutions, from generator gearboxes with up to 8 MW to multi-engine propulsion gearboxes with 50 MW, from jet pump drives to cutters on dredgers. On request, our gear boxes can also be designed with switchable multi-plate clutches. In addition, we offer torsionally stiff ARPEX® couplings for connecting PTO (power take-off) and shaft generator. As a customer, you can always rely on maximum reliability, optimum economy and minimum maintenance costs. In addition, the smooth running of our drives relieves the static and ensures permanently comfortable operation, even under full load.
NAVILUS marine gearboxes from Flender are custom solutions for maritime applications with, for example, PTO/PTI. Here, we rely on our decades of experience in gearbox design. We produce our solutions primarily by selecting from our wide standardized range of tried-and-true, high-quality components. Features of the NAVILUS gearboxes: available as twin-/multiple-drive and single-drive, reduction gearboxes, propeller outputs of up to 50 MW, single-stage and multistage solutions, low-vibration and noise-optimized.

Always by your side – fast, available, competent.
Just as important, however, is our high availability and our willingness to go the extra mile. We are there when you need us. Particularly in the project business, speed, availability and decision-making competence are of the essence. With us, you not only have one, at most two contact persons, you also receive the third design and the corresponding offer gladly and in the shortest possible time. So you benefit not only from solutions that work, but also from fast and reliable decisions. After all, punctuality and personal reliability are among our key success factors, along with worldwide customer support.

60075,Fraunhofer - Institut für Großstrukturen in der Produktionstechnik IGP,corporation,"What will innovative production of large structures look like in the future? The Fraunhofer Institute for Large Structures in Production Engineering IGP in Rostock is conducting research into this. The institute develops innovative concepts for product and process innovations. The research focus is on future-oriented industries such as shipbuilding and steel construction, energy and environmental technology, rail and commercial vehicle manufacturing as well as mechanical and plant engineering. The formerly independent research group was made into a Fraunhofer Institute at the beginning of 2020 and is now the first institute of the Fraunhofer Society to be headquartered in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The decision behind this move was taken on 22 October 22 2019 at a meeting of the Executive Board of the Fraunhofer Society. Increasingly large and more complex structures have to withstand extreme mechanical and climatic stresses.

To address these challenges, a project group was founded in Rostock in 1992 by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA. In 2017, this group became the independent Fraunhofer Institute for Large Structures in Production Engineering IGP, which has officially been an institute of the Fraunhofer Society since 2020. The scientists primarily specialise in finding alternatives that reduce the burden on the environment and workers. The aim of their research is to develop holistic solutions that enable more cost-effective and high-quality production.

Strong research partner in north-east Germany

“Resource-saving solutions for specialist production challenges are a crucial component in central industrial sectors in Germany and Europe”, explains Prof. Reimund Neugebauer, President of the Fraunhofer Society, on the founding of the institute, adding: ""With the opening of the Fraunhofer IGP, Germany is taking a leading position in the development of efficient large-scale structures in production – a decisive contribution to making industrial value chains sustainable and future-proof versus international competition”.

In the new Fraunhofer IGP building, completed in 2021, the future topic “Shipyard 4.0” will be in focus. Among other aspects, the Institute has specialised in research on production technology and processes, as well as on materials subsea. As a member of the Smart Ocean Technology research group, Fraunhofer IGP will also be represented in the Digital Ocean Lab.

Among other projects, the IGP is currently involved in the core development of the German Ministry of Education and Research ""OWSplus - Floating Offshore Wind Solutions"" project. Here, the alliance partners are developing solutions for the next evolutionary stage of regenerative power generation.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

54978,H. Marahrens GmbH Schiffs- und Sicherheitsbeschilderung,corporation,"Quality, competence, and know-how have always been the hallmarks of Marahrens. Starting with engraved signs for the cruise ship “Bremen"" in the 1950s, Marahrens Maritime Sign Solutions is today the first address for quality signage for the maritime industry. From their locations in Bremen in Germany, Turku in Finland and Miami in the US, they supply most cruise lines and shipyards worldwide. They now work on around 20-30 ship projects per year, in addition to day-to-day business.
Marahrens has a division only for maritime signage, so they can take care of the entire process: Design and engineering as well as the installation of an average of 50.000-60.000 signs per ship. Whether new installation or refit, Marahrens supplies all the signs a ship needs: Mandatory safety signs and photoluminescent Low Location Lighting (LLL) as well as complex LED-illuminated signs for the restaurant and funnel logos and ship names. They also manufacture individual wayfinding signs, You-are-here plans, cabin signs, and wall decorations. The conditions that the signs have to withstand must always be considered. For example, the statics play an important role, but the signs must also be resistant to extreme weather conditions and salty air.
In addition to the above, Marahrens employees are experts with regards to the rules and regulations for ship signage and offer mandatory LLL Measurement Service according to SOLAS regulations. As a competent and DNVGL certified company, Marahrens technicians provide their services worldwide.

57631,Haystack Dryers Ltd,corporation,"Haystack Dryers provide family sized, people-dryers for use after water rides or waterplay areas at visitor attractions around the world.  Up to five people can use a Cyclone dryer at the same time, with a drying time of around three minutes.  

Cyclone dryers are an attraction in themselves, are fun to use and they provide an important onboard service.  The dryers warm the body with infra-red lamps and then circulate warm air around the users with a combination of computer-controlled heaters and fans.

Getting dry quickly and effectively is a useful tool before leaving open decks, before eating or to get fully dry before enjoying an activity, sport or spa treatment.  They can reduce slip hazards and the number of towels people use per day.  Dryers work equally well in hot Caribbean climates as well as the cooler regions of Northern Europe and are incredibly resilient to the changing weather.

Dryers generate revenue (where charged for) but importantly provide a much-needed guest service that your passengers will appreciate.   They can be connected to your ship’s cashless payment or swipe card system where needed.

Passengers love to get wet on water attractions but will feel more comfortable if they can get warm and dry quickly afterwards.  Installing dryers is a proven tool to increase spend-per-head and guest satisfaction.

With its products, the family company in fourth generation relies on highest quality - Made in Germany. From its two production sites in North Rhine-Westphalia, the company supplies over 1,000 customers in 68 countries around the world.

The 14 HEICO branches worldwide with their own warehousing and a global distribution network with national and international trading partners ensure short delivery routes and best customer support.

In addition to professional technical support, the HEICO test laboratory offers numerous test options for individual customer applications. 

Safety is a matter of trust
Under dynamic loads and extreme vibrations, bolted joints tens to loosen by themselves. Downtime can result. Regular checking and retightening on unsecured bolted connections is expensive and time-consuming. In addition to this are the costs for maintenance and repair work.

HEICO-LOCK® Wedge Locking Systems
HEICO-LOCK® stands for reliable protection against self-loosening of bolted joints. In addition to the proven HEICO-LOCK® wedge lock washers, the product portfolio also includes innovative product variants and easy-to-assemble combination products such as the HEICO-LOCK® combi-washers.
HEICO-LOCK® offers for every application always the optimal product for sustainable bolt locking.

HEICO-TEC® Tension Nuts
Tensioning of large bolted joints usually requires the use of electric, hydraulic or pneumatic tools. The use of additional assembly tools unusually associated with additional costs and often leads to delays in projects. By using HEICO-TEC® tension nuts, even particularly large bolt connections can be preloaded easily, quickly and reliably using a torque wrench. The distribution of forces makes this work. Instead of preloading a large bolt connection with a high tightening torque and large tools, several smaller pressure bolts are tightened with a significantly lower torque on the HEICO-TEC® tension nut in order to achieve the required preload force.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__12481__240x240px/SM22_2022_229290_3410930_av.png

Sustainability and the responsible use of resources are at the core of all our actions. High flexibility and competence in production and a global sales and services network give us a crucial competitive edge and ensure our customer's lifetime excellence. 

We remain driven by the goal of revolutionizing the maritime and offshore industries with innovative systems for access and maintenance. HPT-Technologies in Austria develops and produces innovative Access and Maintenance solutions for both Vessel Maintenance and Flexible Access Systems for the Offshore Industry. The technologies are highly sophisticated and protected by related IP rights.

For decades the maritime maintenance business did not see any development in automation. Shipyards are causing the highest environmental impacts by using manual processes for surface preparation and corrosion/fouling protection High-performance Antifouling protection coatings are applied manually in poor quality conditions causing unnecessary friction and fuel consumption on the worldwide merchant fleet.

The Hull Treatment Carrier (HTC) is the world's very first environmentally friendly, cost-optimized, and PLC-controlled ship hull treatment system. The Automated Painting Technology combined with the UHP Water-Jetting of the HTC provide an exact and uniform coating, maximizes time efficiency, and minimizes costs.

Offshore Access and Tank Access Solutions are the other two areas of our expertise.

Jack Up Maintenance Platform (JUMP) is a fully modular access platform system designed to be installed on Jack-Up rig legs to enable full maintenance and repairs, including blasting, painting, brace or anode repairs/replacement, etc. Crane and/or workman basket appliances can be added to the platform depending on the workscope. Self-powered provides direct and fully unimpeded access to the worksite, it fully replaces the need for expensive and time-consuming scaffold access.

Internal tank Platform (ITP) is the fastest access solution for cargo tanks and cargo holds.
The main uses of ITP are inspection, blasting, painting, welding, or steel works. Reducing dock and ship laying time while ensuring extreme savings in set-up and removal time makes the ITP a must-have. Providing access to difficult reachable areas by reducing the risk of accidents.

55017,Hull Vane b.v.,corporation,"Hull Vane BV is a Netherlands-based company which provides and develops innovative solutions to improve a vessels comfort, performance and seakeeping. These solutions include Hull Vane® and Foil Assist.

Hull Vane® 
Hull Vane® is a patented energy-saving device for low to medium-speed displacement vessels. Combining Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and our in-depth knowledge of hydrodynamics, we can customise and optimise the design of the Hull Vane® to achieve the highest level of performance. Depending on a vessels suitability and factors such as its length, speed and hull design, a Hull Vane® can reduce fuel consumption by anywhere between 5 and 25%. The Hull Vanes are available in three variants, the T- and U-shaped and the Dynamic Hull Vane®. 

Foil Assist
Foil Assist is an application mounted mid-ship on fast planing craft. By taking up to 50% of the boat’s weight on the foil, rather than the hull, the efficiency and seakeeping in waves are improved significantly. Foil Assist is the solution to back problems for crews who operate on fast RHIBs in waves for prolonged periods of time. Foil Assist also ensures a higher speed can be maintained in waves, while keeping all the advantages of a normal planing craft, with inboard propulsion, waterjets, sterndrives, IPS, or outboard engines.

Find out how Hull Vane®, Dynamic Hull Vane® and Foil Assist improve a vessels capabilities such as top speed, range, silence and seakeeping while reducing lifecycle costs and environmental impact!

55022,HYVA CAPITAL EQUIPMENT SRL UNICO SOCIO,corporation,"Located in Italy, Amco Veba Marine is the dedicated marine crane brand of Hyva Group, one of the global leaders in its sector. The company designs, manufactures and supports an extensive range of folded telescopic and articulated cranes to suit the marine environment and designed for onshore, shipboard and offshore installations.

Amco Veba Marine cranes are designed for various applications, from general cargo handling to ship-to-ship operations. They can be used onboard many different vessels types for various on-board and off-board lifting operations, but also used on offshore platforms and production units.

All Amco Veba Marine cranes come with the double-rack solution as standard to guarantee smooth and safe rotation for the limited rotation angle version, and with the slew bearing for those with the continuous rotation angle.

The cranes are equipped with different safety systems designed for easy use, and designed for minimum weight while providing rigidity for maximum lifting and handling. They are of compact design, so as not to interfere with small vessel stability and space availability.

Strong brand

Amco Veba Marine has been part of the Hyva Group since 2007 drawing on the synergies of a strong, multi-national corporation. 

“Hyva is headquartered in the Netherlands, with more than 3,500 employees , operating across a variety of sectors with 12 plants and over 30 fully-owned subsidiaries around the world,” explained Massimo Magli, Business Development and Sales Director, pointing out that under the Hyva Group, Amco Veba Marine has reinforced its position as a well-known and respected brand around the world.
He revealed that the company has recently defined a strategic plan backed up by considerable investment to further develop the marine business by enhancing the product range and adding new, larger crane versions as well as developing a fully dedicate sales and service network worldwide. A new logo has also been created to improve brand awareness.

New offering

Under its new strategy, both products and services have been enhanced. The company has recently introduced a Multi-Level Protection (MLP) programme, to allow customers to choose different crane protection levels for the environment in which a crane is expected to operate; from softer ambient conditions to the most severe and harsh humid salt environments. As such, under this new strategy, the customer will get the best value-added solution for their specific needs.

The MLP programme is an integrated and structured plan of solutions with care for all crane parts; from complete surface treatment up to the hi-durability of hydraulic cylinder rods, pin protection, hydraulic fittings, rigid pipes, rubber flexible hoses, screws, bolts, junction boxes and all electrical components.

Fuel Consumption and Performance Monitoring

With fuel being the main consumable on board any vessel, while also being the greatest variable in the operation, it is the best place to obtain savings in operating expenses (OPEX).

We help you measure fuel consumption to comply with CII and EEXI by installing flow meters and sending the data to HQ or your preferred partner.

Visit our booth and let us have a talk about the possibilities with our Fuel Consumption and Performance Systems that gives you the ability to directly measure the effect of any changes made on board, effectively showcasing financial impacts of any action.

55063,Karberg & Hennemann GmbH & Co. KG,corporation,"We from Karberg & Hennemann GmbH & Co. are manufacturers and developers of the CJC® Oil Care Systems - made in Germany and Denmark:
-	engine lube oil filter
-	fuel and tank cleaning systems
-	hydraulic filter
-	water separators
-	dewatering systems for transformers (insulating oil, tap changer oil and transformer pits)
-	oil filter for biodegradable lubricants (environmentally acceptable lubricants)
-	off-line filter
-	varnish filter
-	bilge water and wastewater treatment systems.

With the approved Fine and Depth Filter Technology from CJC®, you achieve the highest oil, fluid and water cleanliness within the shortest time. Efficient oil maintenance enables maximum wear protection and lifetime for your lubricants and engines, gears, stern tubes, thrusters, and hydraulic systems.

Especially the latest generation of lube oil filters revolutionizes the maintenance of lube oil in gas engines and 2- and 4-stroke marine diesel engines. Even higher cleanliness classes, lower consumption of filter inserts, and even higher pump flow rates enable installation on even larger engines. In close cooperation with engine manufacturers and operators, we have developed special CJC® Fine and Depth Filter Inserts for the specific impurities in the engine oil of gas engines and diesel engines and optimized them for these applications. Compared to conventional systems, CJC® Lube Oil Filter offers significant advantages to the operators regarding the lube oil treatment: up to 97% less energy consumption, 60% lower lube oil losses, 99% less oil sludge and 96% less CO2 emissions. 

Our CJC® Condition Monitoring Systems with sensors and particle counters help you monitor lubricants and filter in real-time. Sensors, data transfer and data interpretation (automatic, manual) are individually configurable and implementable. The oil condition is an important indicator of the engines, propulsion and hydraulic systems condition. Detect deviations from normal conditions at the earliest to have the possibility to counter-act plannable and calculable. Maximize wear protection and replace your oil condition-based – for even more resource protection and sustainability.

The best: our filter material consists of 100 % natural fibres and meets the requirements of the life-cycle resource management - 0 %plastic, 0% metals. 

With over 70 years of field experience, we are the experts for oil care onboard and in the harbour. Best Practices, calculations and photos from the field you find in our virtual showroom: https://app.virtuell-x.com/event/cjc-showroom/schifffahrt-start

55077,KRAL GmbH,corporation,"KRAL GmbH is a manufacturer of screw pumps of the highest quality and reliability with excellent suction capability and low pulsation for all types of marine fuels and lubricating oils. KRAL was the first manufacturer of a compact, low-cost magnetic coupled three screw pump. 
Critical fluids containing substances endangering the health or the environment should not leak to the atmosphere. KRAL magnetic coupling screw pumps are maintenance-free, hermetically sealed (no product leakage, no crystallization of the pumped media) and temperature-resistant up to 300 °C. Frequent replacement of mechanical seals is no longer necessary; a single installation of a magnetic drive pump is sufficient. This saves costs. 
Sulfur limitation.
Sulfur is important for the lubricity of fuels. Pumps must be able to handle fuels with low sulfur content, i.e., with low viscosity and thus lower lubrication. Viscosity drops to 1.1 cSt and the fuel has lower lubricity, causing damage to the pump. KRAL pumps are capable of processing fuels with low sulfur content. Whether it is just a matter of replacing the pumps or a complete conversion to low sulfur operation, KRAL can assist you.
KRAL two screw pumps are particularly suitable for aggressive, low- to non-lubricating, and contaminated media.
Fuel efficiency is the key to reduce emissions. To reduce fuel costs, consumption must be measured.
KRAL fuel consumption measurement provides highly accurate, error-compensated measured values.
There are many influencing factors that can lead to incorrect consumption values. Measurement systems must provide correct results. KRAL flowmeters are accurate to ± 0.1 % over a wide flow and viscosity range, with reproducibility better than ± 0.01 %.

We have developed and released a new product, “Korea Digital Sextant,” a navigation equipment that can calculate the current position of all ships while sailing. In addition, we have developed a “Damage Control System” that predicts the accident situation and impact in real time in case of a ship accident and effectively supports accident response decision-making.

Both of the above technologies have been certified as New Excellent Technology (NET) by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, and in particular, “Korea Digital Sextant” was also designated as a Korea Innovative Product (KIP) by the Public Procurement Service.

By applying astronomical positioning technology, which is the basis of the developed technologies, we are currently developing a “Smart Solar System” and are conducting R&D to develop it into a product that can be used on land in the future.

An extensive after-sales programme, including the reconditioning of components, rounds our offer off.

In the spotlight of Liebherr’s trade fair presence are slewing drives, which offer an optimum balance between load capacity and torque due to the decades of experience and superior technical expertise.

Among the highlights are also our precision-fit gearboxes DAT250, DAT400 and DAT500. The scope of our services also covers customised developments. Be it a standard solution or a specific one – all of them pass through a rigorous testing at the Liebherr-own facilities. 

Finally, we are happy to present an optimally matched system, consisting of a slewing bearing and a drive, to minimize backlash.

Winches with electric and hydraulic drives are also on display. These are designed particularly for offshore or harbour cranes and are used for continuous operation in high-speed handling of containers, for example. The rope winches can be equipped with several spooling areas on the rope drum in order to operate several ropes. This and the application-specific design ensure reliable and safe operation under full load. In order to meet the requirements of environmental protection, the use of electric drives and alternative lubricants is advantageous, as these reduce noise emissions.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__12658__240x240px/SM22_2022_229224_3474680_av.png

55458,"Lösing, Willibrord Filtertechnik e. K.",corporation,"Company History - The firm of Willibrord Lösing Filtertechnik e. K. was founded in October 1955. The ever-increasing demands of the market were met by progressive programme adaptations resp. product diversification so that we are able to offer our customers a comprehensive product range comprising more than 15,000 items on stock. True to the motto: “We are your one-stop-shop”. In response to the ever more specific demands of the market, we started our own filter production in 1982. Due to the continuous growth of our company we moved into our new facility in the spring of 2009. Since the year 2000 the Lösing group with the affiliated branches Karlstadt, Groitzsch and Weyhe-Dreye is certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001. Our 120 employees are always as competent partners available and are there for you, to make your wishes come true.

Product - In addition to oil, air, fuel and hydraulics filters for mobile and stationary applications, the Lösing product portfolio also includes specific product ranges, such as ventilation engineering and air conditioning technology, water filtration, protective aerators, e. g. for waste site vehicles, particulate filters for industrial trucks and other mobile and stationary applications. Our product range is rounded off by bespoke stainless steel elements, manufactured for individual customers for specific applications, including complete filtration systems for industrial applications, chemical engineering and process technology. Furthermore, we operate in a wide range of industrial sectors, such as chemical industry, mechanical engineering, plant and apparatus engineering, mining. Our field service staff with more than 30 employees is dedicated to providing solutions for complex requirements as well as continuous customer care and expert advice to our existing clientele and new customers.

SEPAR - The product line of Separ fuel water separators with its production is having a major share at the turn over of the company Lösing which has been founded as a trading business. The evolution from a filter distributor to a filter manufacturer has resulted in the enterprise’s new image at the market. A newly built production facility as well as personal reinforcements and the introduction of the quality standard DIN EN ISO 9001 are components of the further innovative product development.

The proven Separ fuel water separators made out of aluminium will be supplemented by a new innovative product made out of synthetic material – offering a wide variety of new features – the Separ EVO-10.

For installation before or after the fuel lift pump we offer our coalescence Filter LKF. This filter reliably removes particles and water from fuel. It is characterised by compact design and the use of lightweight materials.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__12283__240x240px/SM22_2022_228682_3385563_av.png

58457,Marble Automation BV,corporation,"Marble Automation

Having started out as a specialist in automation systems, Marble has grown into a global partner in automation for all types of vessels including superyachts. The company is continuously developing innovative alarm-, monitoring- and automation systems.

Unmanned machinery spaces onboard vessels are subject to strict regulations and require adequate alarm and monitoring systems. Marble Automation has recently released its MS31 system. It has already been granted type approval by Bureau Veritas. The system is installed inside the machine room of either new-build or existing vessels. It functions as a monitoring system of anybody working in the machine room. If no one is in the machine room, the unmanned button is activated. Any crew entering the machine room will switch the unit to manned and will have to report back every 27 minutes. The fully configurable main unit is connected to the extensions MS2006 via a combined power-communication cable. The MS31 system can be used in combination with any existing alarm system. 
The company has just finished the development of a control unit for navigation lights. The MS225 controller is part of a monitoring system which consists of one or more controllers and a HMI device which meet the requirements of the MSC.253(83) resolution.
A direct current (DC) version is available for LED and 24 V incandescent lights, and an alternating current (AC) version is available for 230 VAC navigation lights. Each controller can handle up to 12 double navigation lights and each channel has a removable insert card. “The beauty of this system is that it is compatible with a wide range of navigation lights”. “The system will always be in stock with us, which is a great advantage, because it means there are no delivery times. It can be installed immediately.”

Systems made to measure
Marble Automation works closely with its clients to build their alarm-, monitoring systems from scratch. “This way, our customers can have a lot of input in the final look and feel of a system, ensuring that it truly matches their needs and expectations’. “The beauty of this, is that when the system needs to be renewed, it can be copied completely. This will result in less work for the electrician because the wiring is still in the same place.”
The company’s main strength is its talented pool of software engineers, each of whom has their own specialty. “Every engineer working for us has their own field of interests besides software and that makes them especially skilled at looking at the bigger picture, for instance when it comes to things like power management, engines, or communication. It results in us creating even better solutions for our clients”. “The ship owner can communicate directly with the software engineer and explain how the system should work. This way, we ensure that our clients know that the system they are getting is truly their system.

55141,Martechnic GmbH,corporation,"Martechnic GmbH is a leading expert in oil quality management. Since its founding in 1997 as a family-owned business, the company’s principal objective has been to provide engineers and users with effective on-site condition-monitoring tools for fuel, lube and hydraulic oil. For 25 years Martechnic has been designing and developing innovative technical solutions for easy use directly on site to support smooth running, optimal and reliable performance as well as cost-effective maintenance of on-board machinery, engine and equipment.

Martechnic’s wide range of high-quality products include oil test devices and oil test kits, intelligent oil sensor technology, oil sampling bottles and ultrasonic cleaning equipment. 

The use of on-site oil analysis equipment enables maintenance personnel to routinely measure, monitor and analyse crucial oil parameters such as water in oil, alkalinity reserve (BN), viscosity, density, insoluble particles, iron content, cat fines etc. Regular in-service oil analysis with Martechnic’s portable oil test devices and test kits can help to early detect any off-specification issues (ongoing degradation of the oil quality, abnormal wear) and changes in the oil condition (oil contamination) before an actual problem occurs. Quick and accurate test results and their direct assessment allows adequate preventive maintenance actions to fix minor problems and to avoid costly machinery damages and unplanned downtimes. The used oil condition trend analysis provides possibility to efficiently plan on necessary maintenance time and to extend the maintenance intervals. 

Oil analysis with intelligent sensor technology provides for continuous condition monitoring and real-time data on specific oil parameters. “MT Modular Monitoring System” of Martechnic offers a combination of different sensors for a customer-specific field of application (M/E, generators, gearboxes, hydraulic systems etc.) and an oil parameter to be monitored. Modular design of the MT System provides for flexibility in sensor selection and various combination options. A digital interface for connection with the special display unit “Datalogger” allows continuous data recording and assessment. Automatic early-warning system of the sensors provides for immediate identification of any occurring changes in the oil condition. So relatively small issues can be efficiently tackled at the pre-alarm level during the uninterrupted operation process of machinery.  

Martechnic’s oil sampling equipment includes drip samplers and cubitainers for obtaining representative MARPOL fuel oil samples and various sample bottles for lube and hydraulic oil. All the equipment is completed with a tamper-evident technology for effective protection from any external contamination. 

The environmentally friendly ultrasonic cleaning technology offered by Martechnic provides gentle and efficient cleaning of heavily fouled machine parts with difficult-to-reach areas.

64831,Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited,corporation,"INTRODUCTION
Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) is a Defence Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Defence, Dept of Defence Production. MDL is the lead shipyard serving the nation’s strategic requirements. Over the years, MDL has demonstrated outstanding commitment to build technologically complex and most advanced state of art Warships and Submarines to the highest standards of quality.

HISTORY
The history of Mazagon Dock dates back to 1774, when a small dry dock was constructed in Mazagon Village, Mumbai, to service ships of the British East India Company. Over the next 2 centuries, this dry dock progressively developed into a massive conglomerate that is today universally known as Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited. It passed through various ownerships like the P&O Lines and the British India Steam Navigation Company.  It was established as a Public Limited Company in 1934.  Finally, in the year 1960, the Government of India took over the Yard to further its warship development programme and incorporated it as a PSU under the Ministry of Defence. Since 1960, MDL has built a total number of 799 vessels which includes 26 warships and 6 submarines with 243 exports.

MDL ACHIEVEMENTS IN NAVAL SEGMENT
The company has built and delivered to the Indian Navy 6 Leander Class Frigates, 3 Godavari Class Frigates, 3 Missile Corvettes, 4 Missile Boats, 7 Destroyers, 6 Submarines and 3 Shivalik Class Frigates. 
In addition, 7 Offshore Patrol Vessels had been constructed and delivered to the Indian Coast Guard.

MDL ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMERCIAL SEGMENT
Besides, MDL had also delivered Cargo Ships, Passenger Ships, Supply Vessels, Multipurpose Support Vessel, Water Tankers, Tugs, Dredgers, Fishing Trawlers, Barges & Border Out Posts for various customers in India as well as abroad. MDL has fabricated and delivered 65 Jackets, 65 Main Decks of Wellhead Platforms, 3 Process Platforms, 2 Jack up Rigs, coated 903 Kms. of pipes and laid 586 Kms of Subsea pipelines for ONGC. 
From the initial order for building six Leander class frigates, under a transfer of technology from the British Admiralty, to the sophisticated destroyers, frigates and submarines currently on order, the yard has come a long way. Today, it is the premier and lead warship building and ship repair yard in the country; a Miniratna 1 company producing and repairing world class warships, submarines and other commercial crafts. It is the backbone of stealth frigates, destroyers and submarines for the Indian Navy. 

MDL INFRASTRUCTURE
The infrastructure comprises of facilities like 02 wet basins, heavy duty Goliath crane, module workshop, cradle assembly shop, 04 dry docks, 03 slipways, submarine assembly workshop and special stores. With its augmented infrastructure, MDL has the capability to build 10 Warships and 11 Submarines concurrently.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

55153,Mercodor GmbH Sondermaschinenbau KG,corporation,"Compact fragmentising machines 
for user-orientated solutions
MERCODOR GmbH Sondermaschinenbau KG has been manufacturing custom-made fragmentising machines for volume reduction and recycling for 40 years. In particular, the compact design of the fragmentisers allows decentralised use under difficult local conditions.
Besides traditional areas of use, such as fragmenting production residues and waste in the form of wood, paper, glass, metal chips, food left-overs etc. from industrial and commercial applications, the single, double and quadruple shaft fragmentisers are preferred for use on board ships, in hotels, hospitals and catering kitchens.
The product range includes both stainless steel designs as well as customer-specific and application-specific special solutions. The module-like structure of the fragmentisers enables their customised incorporation into already existing systems and allows them to be combined with all popular delivery and discharge equipment.
The material is fed into the fragmentiser via a hopper on a rotating hexagonal shaft, onto which individual cutter disks are pushed that pull in and fragment the material. The cutting chamber sizes are from 115mm x 230mm to 1100mm x 750mm. Depending on the machine type and use, the machine speeds are between 8 and 70 rpm. The material is discharged either by dropping freely out of the bottom part of the machines or by suction removal by means of a pneumatic blower. Different sizes of sieves can optionally be used to set a particular grain size range. The construction of the machines allows easy maintenance and quick cutter blade changing.
The machines are fitted with a reversing controller to protect against problem materials. This switches off the machine in the event of an overload. A safety coupling is available as an optional feature. The PLC can be programmed to the customer’s specific requirements. 
The quantity, width and shape of the cutter disks used and the blade quality etc. varies depending on the particular task. The shafts are driven by an electric motor via a gear unit, with the drive power being between 2.2 kW and 45 kW. A hydraulic drive is optionally available.

MetaLine combines the well known quality features of wear-resistant rubber linings with a so far unmatched simple cartridge spray application. Thus it is now possible to professionally apply sprayable elastomeric wear protective coatings directly on site. The coating material is based on a polyurethane complex, means vulcanizing is not needed anymore. With the help of the MetaLine cartridge spray gun, the coating is mixed and sprayed on well dosed. Processing is similar to wet paint spraying but without the use of solvents or water. MetaLine Series 700 is already touch to dry after 5 minutes. Film thicknesses varying from 0.5 mm up to several centimeters can be processed in one working step. The coating adheres to almost all substrates. The prime use is the extreme wear protection against impact, erosion, corrosion and cavitation. Especially in connection with pumps, sea water piping, ballast-water treatment systems, strainers, propulsion systems, propellers or rudders the system has proved its efficiency and durability.

55159,Metawell GmbH,corporation,"At the company’s location in Neuburg in Bavaria, Germany, the company Metawell produces and develops aluminium sandwich panels and lightweight components for over 35 years now with great success.
The very light but extremely rigid sandwich panels Metawell® and Metawell® Aluflex are used for numerous applications. In addition to lightweight panels, the company also provides extensively pre-fabricated components, customized lightweight solutions and special products.
Engineering competence, modern manufacturing technologies and last but not least the passion for the products and their applications, make Metawell a competent and strong partner for customers from various industries around the world.

Lightweight elements for marine applications
Metawell® lightweight panels and components are perfect for the wide use in shipbuilding, because of their low weight, high bending strength, additional corrosion protection and minimal material thicknesses. Therefore Metawell® lightweight components are often used e.g. on cruise ships, ferries, luxury yachts and mega yachts. Compared with solid aluminium a weight saving of up to 80 % can be achieved with Metawell®.
The lightweight panels made of aluminium are specifically approved for shipbuilding. For the necessary tests the whole sandwich material was tested. The certificate MED/3.64 C Class Division (Marine Equipment Directive – Directive 2014/90/EU, also called IMO/SOLAS, wheelmark, EC-Type Examination Certificate) is available.

Advantages
•	Good corrosion resistance thanks to the use of suitable seawater aluminium alloys according to DIN and an additional primer
•	Easy processing by using commercial woodworking machinery and best practices of carpenters – both in the workshop or directly on board
•	Easy installation of mounting parts through e.g. glueing, screwing, riveting
•	Corrosion protection, also of the core

55166,Minimax Fire Solutions International GmbH,corporation,"Customized fire protection for You

Global development has resulted in major challenges for all of us. Alternative engines to reduce emissions and the storage of electrical energy create new challenges for fire protection.

Minimax develops, designs and installs fire protection and firefighting systems that meet both current regulations and customer´s requirements. The solutions are individually geared to the customer's application and fulfill the requirements of the classification boards. It´s range of systems covers protection for alternative engines such as fuel cells (whether powered by methanol or hydrogen) or battery rooms and transformers.

The high-pressure water mist extinguishing system ""Minifog marine XP"" offers comprehensive protection for all areas on a ship. A Minifog marine XP system can protect machinery space up to 8,235m2 and achieves a saving of water of up to 90%. Significantly fewer sprinklers are required than with conventional systems. The use of the Minifog marine XP system satisfies the demand for minimizing space and weight, along with the highest safety requirements.

Furthermore, Minimax offers an alternative solution – the MX 1230 marine extinguishing system with the proven and tested clean agent NovecTM 1230. As this extinguishant is neither corrosive nor electrically conductive, no damage can result from short circuits or residue on sensitive components. This makes MX 1230 marine systems perfectly suited to shipping applications and the protection of sensitive components. The non-existing ozone hazard of the extinguishing agent ensures the future viability.

Minimax also covers the entire supply chain for fire protection systems, ensuring that the systems incorporate the latest technology and work reliably. Continuous innovation starts with constant research and development work, risk analysis and technical design and continues with in-house production of key components. 

These additional fire protection systems are:

•	Gas extinguishing systems, like HP CO2 or LP CO2
•	Rotating Pop-Up foam extinguishing nozzle for helidecks
•	Sprinkler and sprinkler equivalent fire extinguishing systems
•	Fixed water-based local application systems for engine rooms
•	Foam extinguishing systems for helidecks and tank decks
•	Drencher systems for car decks and gas tankers
•	Powder extinguishing systems, modular or multi-zone systems
•	KS2000-8 marine extinguishing systems for deep fat cooking equipment

60285,"MOTH Co., Ltd.",corporation,"- MOTH Co., Ltd. has the technology to design, manufacture, and inspect propellers for ships (merchant ships, warships) using carbon composite.

- Carbon composite is a new material that combines the advantages of high strength, light weight, high chemical resistance, corrosion resistance of carbon fiber with the advantages of easy to formability, processability, and low specific weight of plastic. Carbon composite propellers are 50% lighter than metal propellers, as well as, it has the characteristics of 100% strength improvement.

- MOTH has an optimized system of design propeller considering the structural analysis and fluid dynamics of the carbon composite propeller. And the reliability of all carbon composite products produced by MOTH is guaranteed through non-destructive testing, three-dimensional shape measurement, and structural testing.

- MOTH’s marine propellers made from carbon composite have considerable advantages that can operate with optimal performance that improves fuel efficiency, and the naval ship propeller minimizes noise and vibration that make significantly the probability of detection, and has the technology to increase cavitation performance. In addition, we are pioneering the naval defense field with results of design ship propeller shapes that meet the operational requirements of the navy, such as FFX Batch-III and KDX-III Batch-II.

- MOTH’s carbon composite propellers have been developed in a variety of sizes, shapes, and applications to be applicable to all types of transportation in which propellers are used. In addition, as a new material propeller that perfectly complements the shortcomings of the existing metal propeller, it will occupy the next-generation propeller parts market.

57708,Neander Shark GmbH,corporation,"Neander is a cutting-edge outboard engine developer and manufacturer. Using state-of-the-art software and processes, it developed the Dtorque 50, the world’s only 50hp Diesel Outboard. Made by marine professionals, for marine professionals, the Dtorque’s double crankshaft has been a success, both in terms of reliability and efficiency since it went into serial production back in 2018. 
The end users of the Dtorque are commercial operators in the oil and gas, cruise ship, super yacht, harbour patrol, fish farming and tourist industries, and therefore rely on being able to use their boats daily, without interruption. Whilst the company is encouraged by the success of the Dtorque so far, customers are pleasantly surprised by its quietness, low fuel performance and its 111 Nm of torque. 
Neander is excited to continue investing in R&D to offer new solutions to an industry it believes will not just continue growing, but will evolve more in the next 10 years than it has done in the past 30.

58217,Neue Jadewerft GmbH,corporation,"REPAIR SPECIALIST FOR NAVAL VESSELS AND CIVIL SHIPS 

Founded in 1947, Neue Jadewerft serves NVL Group as a state-of-the-art repair shipyard, specifically designed to handle the full range of repair, refit, overhaul and maintenance services for naval vessels up to 160 metres in length. The shipyard also provides these services for civil ships, such as tankers, excavators, container ships, tugboats and more.

With an area of 40,000 square metres, the modern and compact shipyard has highly efficient production capacities. Neue Jadewerft is located in the deep-water and tide-free port of Wilhelmshaven. The location is ideal, as the routes from the main trade lanes in the North Sea are some of the shortest in Germany; vessels reach the shipyard via the world’s second-largest lock. 

We set high standards for the quality of our products and services. Our motivated team provides reliable and flexible support for our customers around the clock and all over the world. Thanks to our committed and highly knowledgeable shipbuilding workforce, we are well placed to take on the range of challenges in the repair sector for naval vessels and civil ships. We develop tailor-made solutions for every customer requirement and implement them efficiently. To uphold our quality standards and a reliable level of service, we use the extensive NVL Group supplier network and work closely with our sister shipyards Norderwerft, Peene-Werft and Blohm+Voss. We are proud of the strong and long-standing relationships we have established with our business partners and suppliers.

From engine replacements, propulsion and shaft work to managing major projects over the course of many years, our specialists develop effective and reliable solutions for the most complex challenges. We take care of every vessel across the fleet, including frigates, corvettes, patrol boats, logistic support ships and service vessels (harbour tugs, high seas tugs and small service vessels). We also carry out maintenance work on crude oil tankers and LNG carriers, as well as mobilisation and overhaul work on offshore vessels. One of our specialities is the maintenance of frigates – we have docked and taken care of nearly every frigate class. Having successfully completed more than 70 maintenance projects for military surface vessels, we have been a key partner for the German Navy in depot maintenance for decades.

Our shipyard is characterised by quality, expertise, efficiency and family spirit. Our passionate and highly skilled ship repairers provide the driving force and source of innovation at our shipyard, ensuring our stringent quality standards are met for every project. We make sure that knowledge is passed on and keep an eye on the future with apprenticeships and dual study programmes.

No matter where you are in the world, our highly skilled mobile service teams quickly perform repair and maintenance work on your boat or ship to rigorous quality standards. Our high manufacturing depth, together with our in-house trades such as the shipyard’s own locksmith and joinery, enables us to be highly flexible and find the best solutions for our customers.

We are proud of our long-standing relationships with the German Navy, public authorities and customers around the globe.

Since 1924 Observator has evolved to be a trend-setting developer and supplier in a wide variety of industries. Nowadays the Observator Group comprises three different branches:
- Instruments (Observator Instruments BV, the Netherlands and Observator Instruments Pty Ltd, Australia)
- Vision (Observator Vision BV, the Netherlands)
- Precisietechniek (Observator Precisietechniek BV, the Netherlands)

Originating from the Netherlands, Observator has grown into an internationally oriented company with sales and service offices in:
- Observator GmbH (Germany)
- Observator Telenav (Singapore)
- Observator Ltd (United Kingdom)

Observator Instruments offers various meteorological and hydrological sensors, specially designed displays and software systems. Deliveries can range from a single sensor to the installation of a complete system of meteorological or hydrological measurement stations, including telemetry and data processing.

Observator Instruments
Our product range includes anemometers, wind systems, helideck monitoring systems, rain gauges, weather monitoring systems, road condition sensors, water level and quality sensors, data buoys, and many more.

In brief, when meteorology and hydrology have priority, Observator Instruments has the best solution. From important meteorological factors – like wind, visibility, temperature and precipitation – to hydrological factors such as wave and current. Regardless of the application area: shipping, container terminals, airports, oil platforms etc.

Observator Vision
Because Observator was founded by a group of ship-owners, back in 1924, the maritime industry is our home market. We know that the weather can have a major impact onboard: the reflection of the sun, the sparkle of the water, the raindrops on the windows. As a supplier of a wide range of sunscreens and window wipers, we compete with the four seasons and the associated interplay of dark and light, wet and dry.

Originally the sunscreens and window wipers of Observator Vision have been developed and supplied for inland and marine vessels. Whether it concerns ferries, cruise ships, dredgers, fishing boats, tankers or luxury yachts.

However, by responding to the increasing demand from other markets, the sunscreens and window wipers have also been optimised for other applications, for example residential buildings, offices, crane cabins, traffic towers etc.

As an ISO-9001-2015 certified company, we apply the highest quality standards to our products. From standard types and versions to custom work. Observator Vision has a suitable, qualitative answer for every question, regardless of the industry to which we supply.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

55211,OneOcean Group Ltd.,corporation,"Holistic voyage decision-making through optimal data and better clarity, onboard and on shore.

OneOcean provides voyage solutions for the ever-growing compliance and navigational challenges faced by crew and shoreside stakeholders. 

With a portfolio that encompasses navigation, environmental, QHSE, and data solutions, the OneOcean Total Voyage approach integrates data, linking dynamic events for effective planning and operationalised compliance. 

This collaborative approach provides a dynamic workflow and enables users to make well-informed decisions, reducing risk and making operational activities more efficient. Data layers include detailed weather forecasts, visual depictions of environmental zones and their associated regulatory requirements, speed restrictions, global commercial port data, piracy and NAVAREA warnings, as well as local, national and international regulations. 

We are proud to support some of the largest commercial maritime organisations globally, allowing users to simplify complex tasks and break down the walls between traditionally siloed operations. As new challenges and regulations continue to emerge, OneOcean is at the forefront of technology, working with customers to respond with agility and minimal disruption. 

Shoreside interface
To achieve optimal operational effectiveness, shoreside teams require transparency of vessel performance in real time with instant reporting mechanisms in place. The shoreside interface from OneOcean provides clarity on vessel positions in relation to other navigational, operational and regulatory data – allowing teams in office to have contextual situational awareness throughout the planning, execution, review and monitoring stages of a voyage.

Data Solutions
At OneOcean, we put data and customers at the heart of everything we do, and our API solutions are no different. APIs give you access to previously out-of-reach data, for valuable insights and more informed decision-making. 

Our navigation and environmental data solutions allow you to tailor the content, frequency and location, where data is received from, to embed into your existing systems. We provide quality data; you choose when and how to use it.

57724,onoff engineering gmbh,corporation,"As a system-independent partner for automation and IT, we develop custom-fit solutions for shipbuilding, shipping, process automation, digitalization and artificial intelligence. 
The shipping industry faces numerous challenges. It is one of the strongest emitters worldwide. New limits for the sulfur content in fuels have been in force since the beginning of 2020. An important contribution to improving the global climate is therefore to abandon heavy oils as fuel and instead use low-emission fuels such as liquefied gas or hydrogen.
We offer planning and implementation for the automation of e.g. high- and low-pressure dual-fuel systems and LNG bunker barges. The basis for our planning is the creation of a digital twin. Here, imponderables become transparent already in the planning stage, thus enabling the reduction of on-board commissioning by up to 70%.
The use of our InfoCarrier® RAMP system enables operators to evaluate dedicated data independently of the IMAC ship control system. These can then be displayed on a monitoring system on dashboards and used in the operation, service and maintenance of various plant components - predictive maintenance. Various communication channels enable the evaluation of this data live or time-delayed on shore.
A large number of national and international rules and regulations have to be complied with. Precise knowledge of these and the creation of new technical rules in collaboration with the various classification societies are key challenges and decisive for successful project implementation. In particular, the inclusion of the regulations of the US Coast Guard and the construction regulations according to UL (Underwriters Laboratories) standards are of central importance here.
As part of the SpiraTec Group, we have been active since April 2022 with more than 600 employees in Germany, Italy, Austria and the USA at 31 locations in order to successfully implement projects related to Industry 4.0 in close proximity to our customers. Our industry focus is on pharmaceuticals, food, chemicals, water/wastewater, shipbuilding and natural gas. However, our customized, future-oriented solutions are also increasingly in demand in other industries such as retail.

PANOLIN ECLs are technologically mature, economically interesting and environmentally friendly.
The aim of the environmentally considerate PANOLIN lubricants is to use machines and equipment in the most environmentally friendly way possible and to do so with the highest technical safety and the best economy.

Rapid biodegradability, CO2 reduction and resource conservation thanks to long-term use are important elements of our sustainable concept.

With our rapidly biodegradable products, we have demonstrated our innovative strength and created a new category of lubricants around 35 years ago. Our environmentally friendly developments are internationally recognized, as the following numerous national and international eco-labels clearly demonstrate.

GREENMARINE is a lubricant concept developed by PANOLIN especially for the marine industry.

PANOLIN HLP SYNTH has been in use for over 35 years in countless earthmoving machines in and on the water. It was followed by other special lubricants for hydromechanical works and hydropower plants.

With all this water-related experience, we looked for new challenges and discovered an enormous scope for marine applications. Innumerable ships are underway day and night. Dredging machines keep harbours, basins and canals free of gravel and silt. Installation ships set up wind power plants ...
The PANOLIN GREENMARINE product line was launched to meet the needs of the marine industry. 

PANOLIN exports the high performance ECLs to 56 countries.
In industries such as construction, marine, dredging, oil and gas exploration and others, PANOLIN is a statement for advanced technology, environmental responsibility and security – due to the 35 years of experience with environmentally considerate high performance lubricants and 70 years of success in the lubricants industry.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

57743,Power Plant Solutions,corporation,"Power Plant Solutions is a leader in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul sector for the marine and power generation markets. With personnel with more than 30 of experience, we serve clients in Latin America, The Caribbean, Africa, and Europe.

Our services include:

Maintenance Repair and Overhauls:

Major maintenances for different engine manufacturers: Whether a 12k hr. or a 60k hr. maintenance, we have specific teams of specialists for each engine type.

100% On-site maintenances: In cases where the situation demands it, PPS mobilizes the necessary equipment (from honing machines, valve grinders, balancing machines, etc.) so no component leaves the client's facilities. This gives the client greater control over the project, reduces execution times, and reduces shipping/freight expenses, especially during these times of increasing costs.

Technical advising, supervision, and execution of major jobs like crankshaft exchange/repair, engine exchange, etc.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Our forensic engineers can help our clients find out the exact cause of an engine failure in order to take preventive and corrective measures. 

Power Plant Audits: whether for internal protocols, to guarantee that the engine is being operated properly by an external party, or a handover audit before ending an O&M contract, our team of experts can assist you in making sure that the engine is in optimal condition according to the manufacturer and international standards.

Maintenance and/or operation contracts for different plant/fleet sizes. 

Technical Outsourcing: are you missing a few members to complete your team? Or do you have the team but no supervisor? Whether for a couple of weeks or a few months, we can provide the technical personnel to complete the team. We have also worked alongside engine manufacturers and other service companies. 

Turbochargers:
We offer minor and major maintenances for different turbocharger brands, turbocharger failure inspections, rotor balancing, vibration surveys, technical support, and 100% on-site turbocharger maintenance, so the components do not have to leave the client's facilities.

Brus-plating:
Widely employed in the aerospace and oil & gas industries, this type of selective coating is used to return component dimensions to nominal values. Specific coatings are highly resistant to corrosion and can be applied to salvage seat pockets, crankshafts, propellers, and shafts.

In-situ Machining:

Our team of experts can perform reconditioning services such as crankshaft machining, camshaft in-line boring, and engine-block/liner pocket machining.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__13971__240x240px/SM22_2022_236361_3493551_av.png

To this day we are still a leading manufacturer of piston rings for 4-stroke large bore (160mm-640mm) diesel and gas engines which are in use within marine, rail, industrial and power generation applications on 6 continents.

Building upon the chrome ceramic and plasma coating technologies as well as the casting competencies of the Industriale business, QIN has invested in our own foundry in Cuorgne (Turin) to bring the entire production process in-house and under our control. By doing so, we have been able to increase our R&D capabilities as well as offering greater flexibility and reliability to our customers by reducing reliance upon 3rd parties for our core processes.

We also manufacture and supply Anti-Polishing Rings, Flame Rings and Repair Bushes.

55296,Sauer Compressors J.P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH,corporation,"Sauer Compressors is a medium-sized German group of companies with fourteen international subsidiaries. The company was founded more than 135 years ago, and has over 85 years' experience in compressed air technology.

International commercial shipping with its stringent requirements for quality and reliability is Sauer’s traditional area of activity. The starting- and working-air compressors have proven their reliability in this demanding market. In particular the low maintenance 3-stage air-cooled starting-air compressors have established themselves as benchmark for modern and cost effective starting-air compressors due to

·        less temperature

·        less maintenance cost

·        less installation cost

As Sauer Compressors’ latest machine exclusively developed for commercial shipping, the Levante series has quickly established itself as a go-to for the maritime industry. In its latest incarnation, the 3-stage air-cooled compressor comes with a fill-up capacity of up to 460 m³/h at a pressure of 30 barg.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

55310,Schwarze-Robitec GmbH,corporation,"Schwarze-Robitec is one of the world's leading manufacturers of tube bending machines. Founded in 1903, the company develops and manufactures pipe bending machines, fully equipped automatic pipe bending cells and bending tools as well as pipe perforating machines, measuring systems and solutions in special machine construction. Schwarze-Robitec is a producer, supplier and service provider in one - all systems are quality products made in Germany. At the main location in Cologne, the bending specialist currently employs 100 people. Currently, more than 3,000 of the company's CNC bending solutions are in use worldwide - some of them for well over 35 years.

Numerous well-known manufacturers from the shipbuilding and offshore industries are on Schwarze-Robitec's reference list. With the pipe bending machines of the Heavy Duty series, the company offers a powerful solution for high-precision and efficient bending of complex pipe geometries for shipbuilding and the offshore industry. They are specially designed for continuous use under very high stress. The high rigidity prevents the machine from twisting. With them, users significantly increase the efficiency of their production and thus remain competitive. Even high-strength materials as well as very large and thick- or thin-walled pipes can be bent to a wide range of bending radii - including particularly small radii. This brings advantages as space-saving piping systems are increasingly required on board ships or on offshore platforms.

Schwarze-Robitec's product range in the field of tube bending machines includes mandrel bending machines, pressure bending machines, fitting bending machines, and membrane tube wall bending machines for processing tubes with diameters between 4 and 420 mm. Schwarze-Robitec also integrates these into application-specific, fully automatic tube bending cells with integrated upstream and downstream processing steps. In addition, the company also offers tube separation systems, bending and punching tools for its machines, and various measuring systems for quality control. The company also designs, manufactures and sells tube perforating machines for punching, perforating and cutting tubes to length.

International sales are based on three key factors: the core sales team operates from the company's headquarters in Cologne. Schwarze-Robitec serves the North and Central American market with a sales team based in the US state of Michigan. In other countries around the world, the manufacturer ensures sales through long-standing partner companies at central locations. The traditional company's recipe for success: the bending experts offer a modularly configurable range of machines and accessories that can be flexibly expanded and adapted to specific project requirements. The result is always an individual solution tailored precisely to the user's needs.

58418,Senmatic A/S,corporation,"SENSORS FROM SENMATIC - ENSURING RELIABILITY FOR THE WIND INDUSTRY

Wind installations are complex setups often operating under extreme conditions. This creates a need for reliable monitoring, precise troubleshooting and competent optimization to ensure efficiency. If errors or issues arise at a wind farm, they can be extremely costly to investigate and repair as wind farms are typically located offshore or in other areas with limited accessibility. Therefore, even the smallest of irregularities or errors can be critical and lead to significant losses. For a setup to be profitable and safe, error rates need to be minimized. Reliable sensors play an essential role in creating high efficiency, maximum reliability, and minimum downtime.

To do so, the wind turbine industry needs business partners, who understand the need for high efficiency, maximum reliability, and minimum downtime in installations. With know-how from 20 years of experience in the wind industry, we work with leading players in the industry, designing and manufacturing reliable temperature and humidity sensors for demanding wind power applications.

RELIABLE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSORS
Our temperature and humidity sensors are designed to work under extreme operating conditions for both onshore and offshore wind turbines as well as turbines installed in remote sites. Our sensors for wind consist of:

- Resistance temperature sensors (Pt-100 or Pt-1000) for monitoring outside temperature, control cabinets, transformers, generators, gearboxes, bearings, brakes, and hydraulics
- Humidity sensors for monitoring of moisture in nacelle or tower

PERFECT YOUR PERFORMANCE WITH EXPERTISE
The technology areas where we excel include mechanical, electronic and software engineering for low and high-temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and gas sensors. Our wide range of in-house technologies, production, R&D, testing, and calibration facilities sustains our efficient and agile development of customized sensor solutions.

Senmatic was founded in Denmark in 1975 and has been a significant manufacturer of integrated industrial sensor solutions for a broad range of industry segments for more than 45 years. We are headquartered in Denmark, where we also have our main production. In addition, we have a subsidiary and production in China.

QUALITY IS THE CORE OF OUR BUSINESS
To ensure superior product quality that meets global requirements, we test our sensors with very high precision in our in-house testing and calibration laboratories. Our laboratories are set up in collaboration with leading Danish experts and certification bodies and can handle both very small and very large sensors. We always work using quality management systems and processes that meet the requirements of global industry leaders and certification for compliance to standards.

63216,Silverstream Technologies,corporation,"For over a decade, London-based maritime clean technology firm, Silverstream Technologies has pioneered air lubrication technology within shipping, optimising and rapidly scaling the Silverstream® System for application across the global fleet.

Air lubrication fundamentally changes the interaction between water and a vessel’s hull, shearing air from air release units in the hull to create a carpet of microbubbles that coats the full flat bottom of a vessel. As a result, frictional resistance is decreased – dramatically reducing fuel consumption and associated emissions.

The Silverstream® System is radical and innovative, harnessing the power of both the air and the oceans – as well as our greatest understanding of fluid dynamics – to deliver real, proven, measurable fuel and emissions savings for oceangoing vessels.

Independent third parties including Lloyd’s Register, HSVA and the University of Southampton have verified that the Silverstream® System generates between net 5-10% fuel and emissions savings, depending on the vessel.

Silverstream has a strong pipeline of orders for its system on both retrofits and newbuilds, from some of the leading names in the sector including MSC, Shell, Grimaldi, Maersk, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Carnival, Vale and others.

The company harnesses strong relationships with the leading owners, charterers and shipyards in order to facilitate its ambitious order pipeline. Opening an office in Shanghai at the start of 2022, Silverstream successfully exports its services to partners across Asia, the Middle East and Europe, with an anticipated turnover in the hundreds of millions of pounds by 2025.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

54826,Soteco International Srl,corporation,"Soteco the pioneers:
Since the late 1990’s Soteco pioneered the global distribution of high-quality spare parts to the international marine industry using its manufacturing base in Genoa, Italy to produce articles of precision to rival original equipment makers. The rapid demand for its products combined with the need for technical support led to the formation of Comtech as the sales channel to further the penetration of Soteco products and reach out to marine operators and power plants across the globe.

A complete offer:
As a complement to the spare parts the need for technical service onboard and onsite was evident and Technoservice became the third brand. Each brand with its own special features combined to provide a comprehensive range of products & services from bases in Italy and Singapore. Soon after other Comtech offices have been established together with a wide agency network of experienced and dedicated companies to serve the marine and power markets together.

A new chapter:
In May 2022, a new chapter begins with all the well-known brands being joined together under one single name, Soteco International. This means that Soteco will embrace all the recognised features gathered over the years by each brand to benefit its global customer base with a simpler way to market and easier communication. All the employees of the companies and its agency network will now represent the single brand and above all, the Soteco brand promises to deliver Quality, Reliability and Value.

Soteco the sole supplier:
It is our vision that Soteco brand will be even more recognised as the easiest and most natural choice as the one supplier of a wide portfolio of products and services that adds value and brings competitiveness to their customers’ operation.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__13216__240x240px/SM22_2022_228764_3486064_av.png

Competence, experience and innovation are the strengths of our company. As a future-oriented industry, we are committed to constant technological development that allows us to be always up to date.
With our induction heaters you can overheat any type of metal, including aluminium, in just a few seconds. Induction heating generates heat only in the required spot and improves the quality standards of the finished work: it quickly raises the metal to high temperatures, but 500-600°C is sufficient to perform straightening and bending operations, replacement of bolts, bearings, nuts, pins, etc. 
Teknel induction heaters provide a very high efficiency; they heat more but consume less than other machines on the market: they are therefore efficient and environmentally friendly because no fossil fuels are burned.
In addition, the absence of open flames and gas cylinders is very important because it significantly increases safety in the workplace. Each device is equipped with an insulation transformer to ensure the absolute safety of the operator even in the most unexpected and adverse situations.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__15072__240x240px/SM22_2022_236158_3515321_av.png

""Energy - Anytime and Anywhere - We Shape Freedom.”

With this vision in mind, Daniel Hannemann and Simon Schandert founded TESVOLT in the summer of 2014. Their goal: to develop and manufacture battery systems that store electricity from renewable energy sources as efficiently as possible. Since trade and industry have the highest energy requirements in many countries, the start-up concentrated from the outset on high-capacity storage systems.

The founders worked on their own battery control technology to make their products as durable and economical as possible. With success: TESVOLT’s award-winning battery management system ensures that commercial and industrial storage systems pay for themselves within just a few years.

But the success of TESVOLT comes not just from its superior technology, but also its agile company structure. In extremely dynamic markets, flexibility, speed and innovation are key. Conventional hierarchical organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to meet market needs. At TESVOLT, self-organisation and team culture are the order of the day, allowing the company to serve the markets of tomorrow with confidence.

Already today, TESVOLT produces its commercial storage solutions in series in Europe’s first Gigafactory for battery storage, delivering them all over the world.

As a globally demanded partner for the production of tube bending and tube processing machines, transfluid Maschinenbau GmbH emphasize on guaranteeing the customer the optimum in added value. Since 1988 transfluid has been further developing its technologies for tube machining, so that it can provide customer-oriented, tailor-made solutions – for plant and machine construction, the automotive and energy industries, shipbuilding and medical device manufacturing. 

Global market and technological leader 
With the process of CNC-controlled rotary tube forming - newly developed by transfluid - the company is the world's market leader and is accordingly presented in the ""Directory of World Market Leaders"" of the South Westphalian chambers of industry and commerce. 

Trademarks and machines 
The ""t"" was introduced as a self-confident trademark. Combined with the brand promise ""the solution for tubes"" it establishes clear differentiation from the competition. And the machine categories offered by transfluid have also been organised into five fields according to brand management:
t bend stands for a wide range of tube bending machines, which fulfill the highest demands in terms of industrial applications. 
The tube forming machines in the t form range offer the perfect tube shaping solutions. Tube forming is important as an individual or supplementary process, in order to obtain optimally tailored tubes.

Treo is a testing laboratory with substantial experience and expertise in shipbuilding. We have the skills and the equipment to test all parts, equipment and components in the field of shipbuilding for function, reliability and safety. Our laboratory is accredited for every type of test required for type approval.

Wind, water, waves –  rough seas take their toll on mighty container and tanker giants and luxury liners. Every ship on the water is at some point exposed to extreme weather conditions. That is why it is essential that the equipment, instruments and parts installed on board perform safely and reliably. To ensure this is the case, our test engineers put all relevant parts rigorously through their paces. With our standardised test procedures in environmental simulation, material testing, electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), we check that all conditions and specifications for the legally required type approvals are met.

Treo is one of only a very few accredited testing laboratories in Germany that are permitted to carry out tests for the type approvals required in shipbuilding. These include climate tests, vibration tests, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electrical safety as standard. The type approval test covers electrical wiring, lighting, navigation and communication devices and propulsion controls, as well as ensuring that all components at risk of corrosion function correctly, e.g., valves, pumps, level monitoring systems and tanks. For the functional and safety testing of these sensitive components, our engineers have developed an accredited test rig which allows them to perform the mandatory “dynamic inclination due to wave action” test required for type approval. Our accredited test methods also include fire tests, which check, for example, the flammability of electrical devices and their housings.

We also work very closely with the major classification societies and coordinate standard-compliant testing programmes, thus ensuring that our tests are fully recognised.

Examples of classification societies and testing standards

• DIN EN 60945
• IACS E10 Test Specification for Type Approval
• IEC 60092-504
• IEC 60533
• Bureau Veritas Rules for Classification of Ships (NR 467) Part C Machinery, Electricity, Automation and Fire Protection
• DNV-CG-0339 Environmental test specification for electrical, electronic and programmable equipment and systems
• Lloyd’s Register Type Approval Test Specification Number 1

Treo supports hardware developers and producers in shipping from the early stages of development through to final type approval. Treo’s many years of experience and proven expertise have made us a highly sought-after partner in the maritime industry.

55410,VAF Instruments B.V.,corporation,"VAF Instruments is well known for the fuel viscosity sensors (VS3) which are provided to global seagoing vessels, and are also at the heart of the many booster units. This viscosity sensor provides necessary information for preparing the fuel with optimal combustion properties. Next to the viscosity sensors VAF has a large portfolio and installed base of fuel flow meters for seagoing vessels: both positive displacement and Coriolis type.

Within the global shipping there is an increased environmental focus. Over the past few years several new legislation has been released, both global via the IMO, and also from EU side. Think in this respect of the EU MRV, IMO DCS, but also the upcoming EEXI and CII regulations, as well as the EU ETS. All these new regulations relate to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of vessels, and start with a proper, accurate and detailed reporting of fuel consumption, and insight in the actual operational ship performance.

In order to support the global shipping operators with fulfilment of the above mentioned new global environmental legislation, VAF has over the past years evolved from a pure sensor supplier towards a total solution supplier. New environmental regulations demand for a more detailed and accurate ship propulsion performance measurement and reporting, resulting in improvement measures.

On one hand this drives for more on board measurements and sensors. On the other hand it demands for a shift of crew manual (noon report) ship performance reporting towards automated high frequency data collection systems, which provides real time information to both crew as well as office performance departments.

The VAF offered portfolio nowadays consists, next to the well-known viscosity-, fuel-, and shaft power meters, also of onboard data collection systems to gather automatically high frequent data from all propulsion performance related sensors. With this VAF IVY high frequent data collection system, automatically all ship propulsion performance KPI’s are determined for both onboard crew, as well for office performance analysts, as this data is send to shore and is available in a cloud environment. Further integration into customers additional cloud solutions is secured via dedicated API’s. Optimal flexibility is therewith provided towards customer requests.

To support with being compliant to these environmental regulations (like EEXI and CII) and to further improve on ship propulsion performance, greenhouse gas reductions, and fuel savings, the VAF solution portfolio is ready with accurate sensors, high frequency data collection systems, onboard and office dashboards, and with cloud data solutions.

60839,Valmet Inc. Automation Oy,corporation,"Valmet is a global developer and supplier of process technologies, automation and services for many industries, including the marine industry.

The company focuses on integrated automation systems, and its latest innovation is the
web-based Valmet DNA User Interface for all kinds of vessels, including ro-pax ferries and
cruise ships.

Valmet also launches new emission control solutions that enable ship owners to achieve
their sustainability at sea goals. The hybrid scrubber is a solution that can switch between
the open- and closed-loop operation modes. Valmet has tested the scrubber and wet
electrostatic precipitator combination, and, as a result, the company can cut exhaust gas
emissions from a marine diesel engine by up to 99 %.

Recently, when Neles became a part of Valmet, we also have valves in our product range.

The company has over 220 years of industrial history and a strong track record in continuous improvement and renewal. In 2022, a major milestone was achieved, when flow control company Neles was merged into Valmet. The combined company net sales in 2021 was approximately EUR 4.5 billion based on the respective company figures.  
Valmet’s shares are listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki and the head office is in Espoo, Finland.

https://www.vdlaecmaritime.com/sox-scrubbing/why-a-scrubber

CO2 Scrubbers
The currently most reliable strategy to reduce carbon emissions is to capture the CO2 released during combustion from the exhaust gases. This CO2 must then be briefly stored on board until it can be unloaded in a port.

A major advantage of a carbon capture system is that it hardly requires any adjustments to the current engine system. The system can be integrated in newbuilds and can also be retrofitted on existing ships.

A very compact as well as lightweight design and very high system efficiencies are crucial for integration in modern systems. 

Turning the tide for cargo and container ships - shaft generators from VEM
Shaft generators are the guarantee for efficient system design and compliance with the latest emission standards for cargo and container ships. VEM builds and supplies these in various designs, e.g. as electrically excited machines, as they have been in use for many decades. But also as permanent-magnet excited variants, in order to be able to save installation space and mass. 
 
Powerful, quiet and efficient - VEM traction motors
Cruise ships, mega yachts and research vessels rely on the noise-optimised drives. In particular, the specially developed decoupling mechanisms and the system understanding of the development engineers are the building blocks of success. Synchronous or asynchronous machines can be used.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__13978__240x240px/SM22_2022_228713_3493475_av.png

55421,Vianen KVS B.V.,corporation,"Founded in 1979 as a manufacturer of professional kitchen ventilation, Vianen has a proven track record leading in high-tech, custom made, commercial kitchen & galley ventilation systems. Vianen produces hoods and canopies for projects such as cruise ships, superyachts, ferries and offshore platforms. 

Vianen's Vianergy II galley grease hood is the most energy efficient extract hood available. This hood model with its internal curved shape and jet stream air support streams requires up to 28% less extract volume for capture and containment of cooking fumes than conventional extract hoods (ASTM F1704 tested). This reduction in extract air volume results in significant reductions in duct sizing and air treatment and conditioning units, generating cost savings both during the building of the ship and during operation.

For cruise ships Vianen produces USPHS hoods and canopies, with the most trusted technologies such as Water Wash automatic washing and UV/C grease reduction systems inside. Vianen also provides innovative systems such as the VéTEC ventilation on demand system, with which the extract and supply air are regulated according to the intensity of the cooking taking place in the galley, generating large savings on heating and air conditioning costs. Vianen also produces the Soliste front cooking unit, a plug and play solution for containing smell and heat while grilling on the outside deck.

For superyachts Vianen provides custom made extraction solutions for both inside the galley and on the outside deck. This also includes the production of hoods which can be lowered from the ceiling with the push of a button, while not obstructing the amazing views on the outside deck when not in use. For charcoal and solid fuel grilling Vianen delivers hoods with Water Misty system inside to catch hot sparking particles with cold water on the inside of the hood.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

Areas of use such as shipbuilding and other offshore systems place particularly high demands on the safety, quality and reliability of pipe systems. For a shipyard, fire is even worse than water. Welding often leads to fires, and employing the necessary firewatch personnel is expensive. 

In the field of shipbuilding, Viega offers numerous different systems for wide-ranging applications on ships and offshore – including CuNi systems for seawater, copper and stainless steel for drinking water, heating and cooling or press connectors for thick-walled steel pipes. Thanks to the efficient press systems, there is no need for complicated joining techniques such as welding, soldering and thread cutting. And press technology offers significant benefits with regard to occupational safety as well.

In some cases, it can mean that firewatch personnel are no longer required to supervise hot work, while extensive preliminary work, platforms and scaffolding can also be eliminated. And if a connection accidentally remains unpressed, there is no risk of any problems. In systems with the Viega SC-Contur, the unpressed connection is guaranteed to be found during the tightness test, regardless of whether water, compressed air or inert gases are involved – and in any pressure range.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__12472__240x240px/SM22_2022_231381_3450426_av.png

We always combine innovative technologies with maximum safety, and accompany operators and manufacturers on the road to resource-saving mobility.

We supply innovative technologies and mobility concepts to accommodate the continuing global population growth and urbanization. At the same time, the major issues of the present are driving us forward, above all climate change, which requires us to develop drive technologies that conserve resources and are future-proof. Based on more than 150 years of experience in power transmission, we have developed an unparalleled understanding of the entire drivetrain. This comprehensive expertise allows us to develop system and service offerings that are precisely tailored to the needs of our customers. As a reliable partner with a product portfolio that is ready for the future today – with alternative drives as well as powerful automation and digitalization solutions – we open up new paths for our customers and provide stability in the mobility revolution.


Voith presents at SMM the electric Voith Schneider Propeller (eVSP)
With the electric Voith Schneider Propeller (eVSP), Voith is pushing ahead with the continuous electrification of its proven drive technologies, thus meeting the growing demand for resource-saving and energy-efficient mobility as well as future-oriented mobility concepts. Among the advantages of the new eVSP are high efficiency and the reduction of complexity, since the permanent-magnet synchronous motor is already integrated in the propeller. The complete omission of gears reduces noise to a minimum and frees up critical space on the ship.

Voith presents at SMM the remote-controlled Voith Schneider Propeller (rcVSP)
With the remote-controlled Voith Schneider Propeller (rcVSP) vessel mooring and casting-off maneuvers are more efficient. The rcVSP concept also improves crew safety. In the research project different concepts for remote-controlled tugboats have been developed. With the focus on unmanned ship assistance operations situational awareness, manoeuvrability, responsiveness and automatic towline connections fundamental requirements have been addressed. Remote-controlled tugboats with the rcVSP significantly reduce the costs for shipping companies and contribute to technical, economic and ecological topics of handling ever growing vessels in crowded harbours.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Aussteller/Bilder/image-thumb__12482__240x240px/SM22_2022_236579_3407974_av.png

The company was founded in 2003 as a privately held public company. The development of all products takes place in Nuremberg, the production takes place exclusively in Germany.

The focus is on the ""TRACKING"" area, i.e. the localization and identification of objects in a specific area. We have significantly expanded our competencies in recent years and are now one of the most important manufacturers in this field worldwide. In addition to the VHF-based, portable position transmitter vmsTRACK-PRO-CS, a highlight is the vmsIONEER. In addition to VHF, the tracking beacon also has satellite communication and thus unlimited traceability thanks to permanent tracking.

Another major area is the topic of ""SAFETY"" at sea. The AIS rescue transmitters of the easyRESCUE product family are handy devices, fully SOLAS certified, and in this size represent the ultimate in this field. The easy2-MOB is brand new on the market, a small rescue transmitter, suitable for almost all automatic ones Life jackets, with AIS and DSC alerts.

The third division focuses on the subject of ""NAVIGATION"". Our AIS transceiver easyTRX3 with SOTDMA technology has an extremely high transmission power, so that ships equipped with it can see and be seen better. New additions to our product family are AtoN transceivers (type 1 and type 3), i.e. AIS navigation aids that display the location of buoys, beacons, objects, etc. in real time on the AIS chart plotters.

Our devices are now used around the world, as more and more national authorities, international organizations, but also global commercial companies are convinced of the performance and reliability.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png

In recent years, the economic landscape has diversified considerably, leading to the emergence of many new specialisations, including production for the wind energy sector (onshore and offshore) or IT (e.g. for the automotive/maritime industry). 

Due to the coastal location of the region, the economic potential of West Pomerania is largely determined by maritime and logistics-related industries and services.  Maritime economy covers all types of activities related to the sea and its resources, and companies located in West Pomerania specialise mainly in :
- subcontracting in shipbuilding,

55451,Western Marine Shipyard Ltd,corporation,"Western Marine Shipyard Ltd., Bangladesh’s leading shipbuilder, was established in the year 2000 in Chattogram. Its mother company, Western Marine Services Ltd., was formed by a group of marine professionals specialized in ship-repair and export of marine supplies. The major intention of the company’s founders was to develop a cluster of technological excellence to meet the global demand of the maritime industry. Initially, the company developed as a shipbuilder with its own shipyard in the eastern bank of the Karnaphuli river, in Chattogram, in the year 2000, over a land of 1.5 acres for building inland vessels and barges. Since then, the company gradually attained prominence as a major shipbuilding company with quality based motivation.

Today Western Marine Shipyard is the leading shipbuilder in the country, standing in over 45 acres of land, modernized into a world-class shipyard consisting of all sort of hi-tech & heavy tech machinery through an investment of Tk.300 crore. It is an employment source for 3500 people, including skilled and semi-skilled laborers. More than five hundred professionals are working in the shipyard as well, including marine experts, mechanical experts, electrical engineers, naval architects & experts in other fields. The yard gained recognition so rapidly, that its fame spread all over the world in a very short period. As a result, today, the shipyard is constructing an array of ocean-going vessels for Germany, Denmark, Tanzania, New Zealand, Kenya, the UAE, Norway, India, Equador, and many more.

The Shipyard has achieved a remarkable amount of international orders of shipbuilding in recent years; some of which are: 8 multi-purpose cargo vessels for Grona Shipping in Germany, 1 ice-class container vessel for Stella Shipping in Denmark, a floating reception vessel for LAMOR Corporation AB in Finland, 2 Passenger Vessels for Karachi Port Trust (KPT) of Pakistan, 1 Ro Pax Ferry for Hundested-Rørvig Færgefart in Denmark, a multi-purpose cargo vessel for Equador, and an Offshore Patrol Vessel for the Kenyan Government, amongst many more orders. The yards’ international standard and recognition has led it to be a leader amongst shipbuilders in the region, and the ability to complete with shipyards globally.","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-eu-central-1-886561356886/pimcore_hmcdp_test_env/tmp/image-thumbnails/digitale-services/Veranstaltungen/SMM/SM22/RahmenprogrammBild/image-thumb__8395__240x240px/sm_pur_rgb_soft.png
